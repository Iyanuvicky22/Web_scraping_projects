Bay of Angels (1963) - full transcript,"Jean is a clerk in a bank. His colleague Caron is a gambler and gives him the virus. In the casinos, Jean meets Jackie. Their love affair will follow their luck at the roulette.","- Checked twice. - And the other? - Which one? - Davidson's. Thanks. What's wrong? Dog-tired. Got to forget figures. I'll take you home. - How? - In my car. - Got a car? - Yes. - Since when? - Yesterday. - It's yours? - Surprised? A bit, yes. Come into money? Curiosity will kill you! We earn the same amount, yet I'm always short. - Don't exaggerate! - I couldn't afford this. OK, I'll tell you, but keep it a secret. Last week, I won a stack at roulette. - Where? - Enghien. A new gaming room. How much? 1,800,000. Not even my wife knows. - You're joking! - Honestly. She must know you can't afford this. I said I'd taken out a 2-year loan. She believed me. So, you live a lie... I have to. I won't leave her, and gambling's a compulsion. - Want one? - No, thanks. She suspects, though. Once, I lost a lot. I got into debt. I couldn't keep the truth from her. We had a terrible scene. She made me swear on our kid's life that I'd stop. I promised. Now, I play incognito. You can't imagine what it's like. - You never gambled? - No. I don't know why. It's a bit like drugs. If I became an addict, I'd be lost. Gambling and drugs are worlds apart! With gambling, you keep your lucidity. It's very stimulating. Come along next Saturday. I'd rather not. You should. You have to try everything in life. You might be extremely lucky. You ought to come along. Even if you don't gamble, it'll interest you. Perhaps. Evening, Dad! - Already 7:00? - Caron drove me home. - He has a car? - He bought a DS. - Is he that rich? - He won gambling. - What kind of gambling? - Roulette, at Enghien. He'll sell it next week. - Why? - Gamblers always lose. - No money left. - I gave you 10,000 last week. You try doing the shopping! You just have to warm the soup. Good-bye. I've known several gamblers. They all ended up penniless. Like Ripert. You met Ripert? Gambling ruined him. He wrote dud checks, went bankrupt. And his wife left him. She was fed up of begging for 50 francs. Now he's alone. Know what he does now? He's a night-watchman. There's no shame in that, but he was a manager... living like a prince. You must admit it's sad. And it didn't stop him. He gambles in the daytime. - Where? - The betting offices. If he enjoys it... Well, I hope you never do. If I ever hear you're gambling, you can pack up and go. That's smart! As your ma said: 12 fishermen, 12 hunters, 12 gamblers... make 36 idlers! I've no need for an idler here. I'm old enough to decide. You can do as you like. So will I. Disaster! - What is it? - Yesterday, I lost a lot. How much? I can't tell you here. I must win it back. Mr. Fournier, the manager wants to see you. - On vacation Saturday? - Yes, sir. - Give Mr. Fournier his pay. - Yes, sir. Will you please sign here? You must come with me Saturday. - I need you to win. - Really! An intuition. Don't refuse. - When? - Saturday, I said. I can't. I've lots to do. Come, or I'm done for. I'll try, but I can't promise. - How much will you bet? - 5,000, I guess. To win a lot, you must bet a lot. I took all the money I had left. Double or quits, but I'll go all the way. I don't even know the rules. I'll tell you. You'll see, it's child's play. - I don't have a card. - They'll give you one. - How long for? - I don't know. - The minimum. - Which is? - Two weeks. - I won't come back. Don't be so fussy... Sorry! Your ID? Thieves, all of you! Quiet! Don't make me call the police. Just go! Get off! - I'll make a scandal! - I wouldn't. I'll have the place closed down! - Please leave. - Crook! The manners of a peasant! - Who's that? - Industrialist's wife. Big gambler. - Why was she thrown out? - I don't know. She is not to be allowed in the casino anymore. Not very gallant. We can't keep upsetting our customers. Last week, she had a first warning. - Was she cheating? - Not exactly. The usual thing. She tried to rob us twice. Well, let's forget this incident. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Come, we've lost enough time. 30,000 in chips of 5,000. 5,000 francs. - In 200s or 500s? - 500s. You won't go far with that. - What's that? - A betting formula. - What's it for? - To anticipate what'll come up. The minimum bet is 500 francs. Maximum, 15,000. I don't get it at all. For instance, you put 10,000 on number five. You can win 35 times your bet... 350,000 francs, plus your bet: 360,000. - For every number? - That's right. - Red, black, odd and even? - Hang on. - They double your bet. - What's the point, then? You've got a 1 in 2 chance. With the others, it's a 1 in 36 chance. 13, black, odd and manque. Ah! 13! There's also trio, split, and square bets. - ""Split?"" - That. 2 numbers at once, but you win half as much. You know enough now. You'll learn the rest by playing. - What should I choose? - Now? - Yes, we're here for that. - 13. It just came out. Numbers rarely come out twice in succession. Do as you like. 13 for me. It's crazy... 13! - How much? - 10,000. 500 is enough for me. Place your bets. No more bets. 33, black, odd and passe. Well, maybe you're not lucky. - I don't get it. - You chose a bad number. Seven, and 1st dozen. Thirteen. Don't keep playing the same number. 13, black, odd and manque. Just a lucky break. It's a game of chance, isn't it? - Whose is the 500? - Mine. 17,500. Place your bets. Twenty-four. Are you sure? Do as you like, but leave me alone! Square, 24. Let's go. I'm about to lose. - Stay a bit longer. - Do as you like. I'm leaving. 480,000. 410,000. You lacked daring. With your luck, you'd have won more. - Or lost. - You should've gone on. I felt my luck was turning. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing... Gambling. I just won 6 months' pay in under an hour. - You can lose it, too. - So? How will you use it? I don't know. A trip! Go to the Riviera. - Why? - We could meet up. Nice and Monte Carlo are great! The stakes are much higher there. And it's not the same. People live for gambling there. I'm staying in Cannes with friends. I go every year to relatives in the country. I can't get out of it. - Gambling's fun, but limited. - It's nice to win a lot. Yes... but I feel uneasy about it. I don't deserve that money. I feel as if I stole it. That's stupid! Thanks a lot! See you soon. On the Riviera! We'll see. Your uncle has written. They're expecting us next week. - I'm not going. - Why? I want to travel. You'll travel later. You're young. - Not really. - You liked going there. I've changed. - Traveling's expensive. - So you've said. Don't count on me to pay for it. I'll manage. OK, spend your savings in three weeks. Fine! My savings are mine. Buy shirts instead. Shirts? Look at that! Dozens and dozens of shirts! What's this? The other day, you said... I said I had no money? Today, I have. It happens. Money can grow on trees! - What did you do? - Nothing bad. I gambled and won. Up to now, I've acted like a mild-mannered kid. But it's over. I need something else. But I won't end up like Ripert. My feet are firmly on the ground. And I intend to win even more. So, Uncle can wait. How much did you win? 500,000 in less than an hour. It isn't any more immoral than anything else. No more so than poverty or ugliness. I won't be responsible for your debts. - Meaning? - I won't have a gambler here. - So you're turning me out? - Go away. - Don't say it twice. - Go away! A room, please. Take the gentleman to 18. Sir, please fill out your form. - Are you staying long? - About two weeks. Where's the Promenade des Anglais? Two minutes away. Straight ahead, then left. - The casino? - On the Promenade? A large white building on the right. Are you going to gamble? - Do you mind? - I couldn't care less. But pay me one week in advance. As security. You never know, with gamblers. Some get ruined and can't pay us. I need a card. - For how long? - One month. Your ID, please. - Ever been here before? - No. 1,000. 100,000. - Plaques or chips? - Chips. - 5,000s or 10,000s? - 5,000s. Place your bets, gentlemen. Thirteen. 5,000 on 13. No more bets. 12, red, even and manque. Thirteen. 5,000 on 13. No more bets. 9... red, odd and manque. 13... black, odd and manque. 5,000 on 17 for Madam. Seventeen. 5,000 on 17 for the gentleman. 35, black, odd and passe. - Three. - 5,000 on 3. - Three. - 5,000 on 3. Three, red, odd and manque. 175,000 for Madam's 5,000 francs. 175,000 for the gentleman. - For the staff. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - You're thanking me? - Yes. - It's just chance. - Lf you say so. What should I choose? 17 has a good chance. Why 17? Why not? Seventeen. 17, black, odd and manque. 175,000 for 5,000 francs. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. 350,000 for the 10,000 on 21. Eight. 350,000 for the 10,000 on 8. - For the staff. - Thank you, sir. - Let's go before we lose. - But we're winning! I'm sure of it. 850,000. 900,000. It's funny... really funny! What's funny? Well, no, it's not so funny. Well, you know, life has its tricks... - Its oddities. See what I mean? - Not really. A while ago, I'd lost everything. - Your money? - Money and jewels. Then you came. I was on my last chip when you advised me to bet on three. - Ice cream? - No, thanks. A strawberry ice cream, please. No, coffee. No, strawberry! 100 francs. I couldn't even go back to Paris. I'd staked my rail ticket. I mean, the money for the ticket. - That isn't funny. - Yes, it is. Want some? It's not very good. - Not very... - Very what? Not very... Oh, nuts! - Where was I? - You said it's funny. Yes, when I left my hotel, I'd decided to go back to Paris. I went to the station with my bag. I had just enough money. When I was about to buy my ticket, I got the urge! I left my suitcase there and came back here... almost against my will. You understand? I gambled all afternoon. I hoped to make up my losses. I stupidly kept playing 17, sure it'd win. But I kept losing. I thought to myself: I can't go to Paris, but I can go to Dijon. Then, it was Lyon. After that, hitch-hiking. With my last chip, I couldn't even go to Marseille! So, I played and lost it! Like Enghien. I believe I saw you there. You're mistaken! I don't know Enghien, regrettably. It's said to be nice, as resorts go. - I thought... - No, it wasn't me. Maybe we met in Deauville. I often went there last winter. - I've never been. - Then you're mistaken. What if you'd lost your last chip? I've already been in a predicament like that. I'd have slept in the station. I'd have gone to Marijo's. A friend. She helped me out twice already. I promised her I'd stop gambling. - Why? - Why what? Why did you promise? To reassure her. I had no intention of stopping. Jacqueline Demaistre. Demaistre in one word. Jackie to my friends. You? Jean Fournier. It's banal, but... I'm laughing because I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in two days, except the ice cream. I'll invite you. If it's all right with you, I'd like... I'd like the best... A terrace, a band, and champagne! - What a funny idea! - Doesn't it ever happen to you? All this is new to me. I thought such a lifestyle no longer existed. Don't get me wrong. I mean... only existed in the movies or certain American novels. What lifestyle? This hotel, this terrace, this band... This opulence... And you. Me? So I'm like an American book? A character in a novel, yes. That's strange. I'd never thought about it. I love that tune. Do you like to dance? I'm not a good dancer. I want to move. - Please! - No, you first. Just a question: Why do you gamble? It's simple. The happiness gambling gives me... can't be compared to any other. When married, I gambled in secret. - Did I hurt you? - No. Not you. Someone kicked me. - He knew nothing? - Who? Your husband. Not at first. You know how it is. But I've always been passionate. Then a strange thing happened: Pierre became jealous of my passion. So jealous! You can't imagine how jealous! Perhaps you're the jealous kind, too? Me? Not at all. Go on. It was absolutely ridiculous. He begged me to stop, but I couldn't. It wasn't for money. Pierre's rich. No, pure jealousy. Scenes, fits of anger. Everything I hate. It was unbearable. So I asked for a divorce. Thanks for indulging me! I took all the blame. He got custody of Michou, my little boy. I've got no rights. I can just see him once a week. I always refused my husband's money. Today, I could've said: ""Pierre, I'm on the Riviera. I need money."" He'd have sent some at once. But I don't need him. I can manage by myself. - You're proud. - No, not at all. But why drag up the past? Look. This is Michou last summer. - How old is he? - Three. The check, please. I don't know why, but I feel my luck's come back. Do you get that impression? - What impression? - It's hard to explain. If I went back to the casino now I know I'd win every time. Come with me! I'm going back now. It's been a long day. I'm tired. I promise we won't stay long. Believe me, you must never let luck pass you by. Come on! 500,000. What will it be? 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, and 1,000. 500,000. - Sir? - 500,000. - Same thing, sir? - Same thing. What does luck say? - It says three. No? - Perhaps. 30,000 on three. I choose five. - You shouldn't. - We'll see. Then let's play three and five. 30,000 on five. Three... And red. 35, black, odd and passe. 30,000 on seven. 200,000 on red. - You're mad! - I have to win. And you? Seven and red. You seem so certain. 33, black, odd and passe. - I don't understand... - Play the 3rd dozen. - Think so? - It's obvious. - Where are you going? - I have to get some more chips. 31 and 35. 150,000 on black. Three, red, odd and manque. Take my place. I'm done. It didn't work. But we'll win. I can feel it. 300,000 in plaques of 100,000. Give me 50. - He tried to cheat. - How? Ask the croupier. He tried to steal a pile of chips. Calm down, please, gentlemen. The game's going on. - What happened? - The croupier said a name... and one man took another one away. Seventeen. Black. Eleven. Black. Nineteen, red, odd and passe. - That's that. - What? - No chips left. - No more money? I changed it all. And you? Me, too. How much is left? 30,000. And about as much at the hotel. Lend it to me. Your 30,000. You'll lose it. You've got more at the hotel. I'll reimburse you. You can't. You'll lose it. How do you know? We're both unlucky. Let's go. Lend it to me! Ask the casino for a loan. I can't ask them for any more money. I can't give them enough security. Then stop gambling. I must win. I'm broke. I admit I was imprudent. I swear I'll repay you tomorrow. I'll bet on 23. I'm sure to win. - You're stupid. - Thanks! 23... quick! 23, red, odd and passe. - You're hateful! - Forgive me. - Now lend it to me. - What number? - Seventeen. - Why? Don't argue. Give! Seventeen. 30,000 on 17. Nine, red, odd and manque. Let's go. - What a dope I am! - We can't help it. I get had every time. I'll never gamble again! You're just saying that. Come off it. I forced you to, you were tired. I was undecided. No, you're just saying that. Gambling is stupid. I behaved like a lunatic. I'm furious. Forget it. I'm thirsty. Can we afford a scotch? I've got some change. Five, six, seven... 730 francs. Nothing. Oh, yes! 1,000. We're saved! - How much? - 1,500 francs. We can't afford another? What will you do? You've made me yawn, too! I'll go and sleep. I could go to Marijo's. It's a bar like this. All bars are alike. She'd have no room for me, anyway. No, I'll go to the station. - The waiting room! - You know? A little. I'm really sleepy. We'll get your bag from the station, then go to my hotel. I'll rent you a room. You'll sleep better there than on a bench... between a cop and a soldier. That's so nice of you! There's no bell. Nobody in here. Don't wake everybody up. I'll sleep in an armchair in your room. We'll save money. Make yourself at home. There are coat hangers. Here's the armchair. Do you often sleep in strange men's rooms? - I know you! - I might be a con man. What would you get out of me? I'm broke. As for the rest, I'm not shy. I guessed as much. What does it mean to ""know"" somebody? I'm here with you. I could be with another man in another room. My husband, say. I don't know him better than you. So him, you or another... I don't care! That the bathroom? May I? When I'm broke, I play by myself. I've played for whole days, in hotel rooms. And whole Sundays. - Never done that? - No, never. - Why? - I'm not a real gambler. - When did you arrive? - This morning. - On vacation? - Yes. It needs ice. I could try to have some sent up. Forget it. I see a Sioux's head. Where? There... The feathers, the eyes... Don't you? No. What a kick I got! Well, they're ruined! I lied to you earlier on. I know Enghien very well. I was banned from the casino because... None of my business. You really don't want to know? No. Give me the courage to leave tomorrow! I dreamed you were leaving. When I woke up, you weren't there. For a moment, I didn't know if it was a dream or not. What did you feel? I don't know... Nothing. You're frank! I mean, it felt kind of funny. Don't be stupidly sentimental. I would've said good-bye first. Have you made your mind up? Yes. I'm going back to Paris. What time is it? 12:30. - Breakfast? - I haven't got time. No. I'm going to see Marijo. Not at her bar... at her place... Well, her boyfriend's. Then, I'll go to the station to wait for my train. - Want some money? - No, don't worry. Marijo will take care of that. A strange girl, Marijo. She was a big gambler. One day, she had enough. And she was very brave... Are you listening? She made the casinos ban her. She wrote to some state department. I could never do that. Pretty good, huh? Yes... Let me do that. I admire her. When she was too tempted, she went to Italy. But as the trips were expensive, she stopped gradually. Now she's running that bar. I've got everything... Thank you. Good-bye, Jean. I may not see you again. - Want my address in Paris? - Lf you like. 4 Rue Louis-le-Grand. - Near the Opera. - Yes, I know. Good-bye! I'll be on the beach. If you have time before you go... Yes, perhaps. I never thought you'd come back. Nor did I. And yet here I am. I waited for Marijo. She was still asleep. When she came with her guy, we had to chat. I didn't want him to know. After he left, I had to do a lot of talking. She said she had no money on her. Lies, of course. In the end, I got 20,000 francs out of her. Then I walked to the station. Why did you come back? To see you before I left. To see me or to have a last gamble like yesterday? I don't know. I wanted to stay here longer. Here or Paris... what's the difference? You have to be somewhere. No one's waiting for me. At least the weather's good. What about Michou? I've got the feeling I gambled him away. Anyone waiting for you? No, no one. What do you do? - Meaning? - Work-wise? A bank. I give chips away, like here. Live alone? With my father. Ma's dead. You don't want to get married? I was engaged, once. But at the last moment, I got scared. I saw what I'd turn into. I saw an average life, without any risks or surprises. So I broke it off. These pebbles are so uncomfortable! Sit on this. Staying here? Why? You want to go? I might make up some of my losses. Suppose I win 100,000. Not asking for much, am I? With 100,000, I swear I'd quit gambling and go back to Paris. What do you think? What can I say? - Coming along? - No, not now. Tonight, maybe. I'll be long gone. Now's the same as tonight. I've one week paid at the hotel, and 30,000 francs. This display of flabby flesh makes me sick anyway. I'd rather look at gamblers. Won't you come? Just to see. You'll lose your ticket money again. - I'm not mad! - Then leave it here. No, because I'm not coming back here. Good-bye! Three. 5,000 on three. Red. Six, black, even and manque. - Going? - I lost my ticket money. Now leave me alone! Excuse me. - Want a seat? - No, I'm just looking. I'm hesitating between 22 and 28. What do you think? Do you have a favorite number? - Yes, 17. - Really? - I assure you. - Take this. Go on, play for me. - Seventeen. - 10,000 on 17. Do you gamble often? Sometimes. You won all this? Yes, I've been lucky. 11, black, odd and manque. - But you're not. - Sorry. Our luck may turn. Come have a drink on me. Gladly. - 20,000. - 1,000s or 5,000s? 5,000s. Sit down. He got the message! - You know him? - No. You had a good time. - What? - Forget it. - 23, red, odd and passe. - Yes! 350,000 for the 10,000 francs. Your luck's come back. - Slut! - What? I said: ""Slut!"" Don't make a scene. You're disgusting! - 32, 33, astride. - Don't do that! 1st 12, straight eight or square bet. Eight. - 300,000 on black. - Eight. So you're a hustler? He gave me a chip. For a chip, you'd walk the streets. Quiet! Eight, black, even and manque. Don't pull a face. Smile. Or else I'll leave the table. You won't smile? No, stay! Forgive me. 1st or 3rd 12? The 1st 12, 6 and black. - 20,000 on 6. - Six. - 200,000 on black. - Black. Six, black, even and manque. For the staff. Red and one. Red... and one. One... two... three million... Four million... And one... two hundred thousand. Thank you. Lucky I've got my suitcase! When you think everything's lost, your luck returns! - My suitcase! - It's here. I was worried! I must absolutely go to Monte Carlo. - When? - Now. - It's 3:00? - 4:10. It's stopped. I left my jewels in Monte Carlo. What a fuss! I sold them. For a low price. I couldn't do otherwise. I owed the casino a lot. At times like that, you don't think. Now I can get them back. Above all, there's a pair of pretty diamond earrings. I also had a necklace, but I never wore it. - What? - You amuse me. - Did I say something silly? - No. Know Monte Carlo? You must come with me. Its casino is one of the finest. I know. - So you'll come? - Lf you like. I've no evening dress. It's optional, but it's smarter. You need a tuxedo. You'll see, we'll live the high life. Know the Hotel de Paris? Of course not, since you've never been there! - You're quiet. - You're not! Because I'm happy. It makes me... versatile. No, voluble. Is that the word? Ah, the Hotel de Paris! There's no finer hotel. There's no point in staying here. Let's go, then. It'd be nice to have a car. - I get you. - Why? Listen: If you buy the car... I'll pay for the Hotel de Paris. - Is that fair? - It's fair. You can find some very nice second-hand cars here. Just what we need. - 1,200,000. - So what? A room for two. No, darling, take a suite, with a terrace. We'll be more comfortable. Look, Jean! It's marvelous! I'm happy! - Coffee. - Madam? Nothing, thank you. Which one? - That one. - You think so? You asked for my opinion. Yes, you're right. I'll go get my jewels tomorrow. You like this luxury? What luxury? Here? What you call the high life. Yes and no. It amuses me sometimes. But I don't mind not having it. It doesn't bother me. But you gamble for money... No! I don't like money. You see what I do with it when I have it. If I loved money, I wouldn't squander it. Gambling attracts me... by its stupid mixture of luxury and poverty. And also the mystery of numbers... chance. I often wondered whether God ruled over numbers. - You don't believe in God? - No. - Ever wondered about it? - No, never. The first time I entered a casino... I felt as if it was a church. I had the same emotion. - Don't laugh. Try to understand. - I'm not. I tell you, gambling has become my religion. Money means nothing to me. Nor this robe, this room. Nothing. I knew you wouldn't understand. One chip is enough to make me happy. As for the rest... - And the others? - Who? Your husband, your friends? I don't owe anyone anything. Why deny myself this passion? In whose name? I'm free! No! I don't need your pity. I don't deserve it. What am I for you? Am I nothing other than an object to you? Haven't you got a heart? Look at me! Never do that again. You've no rights over me. None! We're partners in a game, that's all. Forgive me. I don't want any misunderstandings between us. We mustn't mix our feelings with a situation... that is hard enough for me. Then why are we both in this room? Why are we living together? Well? - I don't want to hurt you... - Too late! I thought you'd understood. Well? Answer me! You're hurting me. Well? You want to know? Why I drag you behind me like a dog? You bring me luck, like a lucky horseshoe. Forgive me! What did you bet on? 33, and black. Nine, red, odd and manque. See? When you're not here, I'm unlucky. Take the 1st dozen. Three only came up once. Three, if you like. Three. 10,000 on three. 13, black, odd and manque. Here, change this for me. 600,000. How do you want it? 10,000s, 50,000s and 100,000s. Another table. The croupier has the evil eye. 17-19. Odd. - What did you pick? - Two and black. 12, red, even and manque. Let's go home. We must win tonight. I'll put all I've got left on five. - Eight has a good chance. - Why? I don't know why, but I feel eight will come up. - Eight. - Eight. Black. Five, red, odd and manque. Let's go. - Nothing left? - No. And you? - 5,000. Should I gamble it? - No! Come along. - I lost 900,000 francs. - And me, 700,000. Nine plus seven is 16. That's 1,600,000 between us. We should've left. I was sure eight would come up. Fournier! I never expected to see you here. Caron, a friend. Jackie. Glad to meet you. - When did you arrive? - Today. I'm at the Carlton, at Cannes. I'm pleased to see you! Just a minute! I won two million at Cannes. I hope to double it here. You caught the bug, too, you rogue? How's your luck? I won a lot last night, a bit less today. - How much? - Almost 3,000,000. Wow! Congratulations. So long, pal. Bye, Miss. Come and look me up. Wait for me! - How much have you got left? - 1,000 francs. Can I have another scotch? Yes, just one... Waiter, a scotch. Forget it. Money! What's money, after all? - I'm sorry now. - Why? If I'd bought back my jewels, I could have sold them tomorrow. We'll have to sell the car to pay the hotel. - Why not? - I took precautions. Lend me 100 francs. What precautions? I've got 100,000 francs at the hotel. You're wonderful! You think of everything. Lend me another 100 francs. Money for another scotch, darling! Tomorrow, we'll return to Nice. The Bay of Angels brings us luck. The same room? If possible, yes. Number 18, wasn't it? It seems ages since we left this room. The Sioux is still there. I've been had. You knew I kept it to pay for the hotel. Why didn't you tell me? I'd have given it to you. You wouldn't have! I wouldn't have had to sell the car. The guy saw I needed money. What you did hasn't a pretty name. - Meaning? - It's called theft. Do you mind! We won that money together. And I wanted to surprise you. Win a pile. Nice surprise! Now we're broke. - How much have you got? - 360,000. That's OK, then! - We can win millions. - What if we lose? - We'll cheat. - Done it before? Yes. At Enghien twice, but I was spotted at once. I don't know... I could make eyes at the croupier. It'd be easier than forging chips or bills. But croupiers are incorruptible. They can't cheat anyway. - How do you know? - Try it and see. I'm ready. - You're serious? - Are you afraid? Yes. Of ending up like you. I'm waiting. I swear it's the last time I'll gamble. - Even if you win? - Even if I win millions. - What's up? - That's the way it is. Croupier, 26. 10,000 on 26. I think it'll work. The 3rd 12, croupier! 20,000 on the 3rd dozen. I think it's working. Ten, black, even and manque. - I don't think it is working. - Too bad. The 3rd 12? 30-32. And red. - You surprise me. - Do as you please. 60,000 on 4-8, square bet. 60,000 on 4-8, square bet. - That's stupid. - Charming! He's not even looking at you. 35, black, odd and passe. - That all you've got left? - Yes. I'm out. - Do I bet it, or not? - Bet it. - Got any money? - 10,000 at the hotel. - It's your fault. - Why? You trusted the croupier too much. I'll play 17. My lucky number. 12, red, even and manque. We won't go far with 10,000. - Someone could help us. - Who? - Caron. - Who? - The pal I met at Monte Carlo. - Oh, that tall guy. I'll get him on the phone. The Carlton, at Cannes. - Know the number? - No. I'll go up and rest. Hello? The Carlton? No, I'll hold. Mr. Caron. Caron left this morning. Where is he? He didn't leave any address. - What's wrong? - I have a headache. Can't you ask Marijo? She was much too nasty last time. I wouldn't accept a cent off her. I refuse to see her again. You said she owed you money. She did, once. Now it's the other way around. So you lied to me! Don't shout! I don't feel at all well. Your husband? He refuses to give me anything. He is rich. But I'd rather beg than ask him. When you said he'd help you, you were lying? Yes. Why? I don't know. Crying? It's nothing. At times, I feel ashamed. I feel rotten inside. I fight it, but it's stronger than me. I lie. I betray. - I spoil everything. - That's not true! What are we going to do? I'll write to my father. If I send him a nice letter, he'll soften. I'll admit I was wrong. I'll say: ""Dear Dad, our quarrel grieved me a lot. Forgive me for having caused you pain..."" See, I'm no better than you... You have a note from the Post Office. It's for a money order. I couldn't sign for you. There's a letter, too. - Yes! - What? - Dad sent money. - I'm happy for you! You bought fruit? What fine peaches! And olives, apricots, and grapes. You're an angel. We can go to Paris tomorrow on the night train. That's sweet, but I won't go back to Paris with you. - But you said... - I changed my mind. - Why? - It's not easy, you know. Sure, we could live together and be happy for a while. But what for? I could never stop gambling. So what's the use? Let's part on good terms. Let's avoid useless scenes of grief... hard words... and much sorrow. But I love you! I know, Jean. Do you love me? Yes, Jean. But not in the same way. I need you! And I can help you. Together, we'll fight to get over this. We will be happy. I wish I could believe you. Well... it's a fine idea, but it's impossible. I know myself. It's too late. ""Too late?"" You sound like a novel! Call it what you want. For the last time, please think it over. - Where are you going? - To the Post Office. - Are you mad at me? - A little, yes. ""I am sending you 50,000 francs. ""Come back home any time you like. ""I won't ask any questions."" Seen Mrs. Demaistre? She left right after you. She'll be back. She left her bag. Where is she? I don't pay attention to what the guests do. - You could've left a note. - I didn't have time. - Twenty-three. - 30,000 on 23. 2nd dozen. - I'm going back to Paris. - I won't stop you. - You had no money left. - My watch. Want to bet? - Come with me. - No, Jean. Where will it all end? Come on... come with me. Nine, red, odd and manque. You're making me lose. Go away!",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Bay_of_Angels-56846
Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas (2006) - full transcript,"When his journal of bright ideas is stolen, college freshman Bickford Schmeckler (Fugit) has to blanket the campus in order to locate it.","[rock music] ? ? (The Faint) ? I feel a warm resistance ? ? beneath the outer layer. ? [muted music] ? ? That's too goddamn elegant not to be true. (The Faint) ? Not speaking, prince, now, are you? ? ? Not breathing one more breath. ? ? ? (man) Oh, yeah, that's a full load. That is a full load. [coughing] Wow. Next! No, no, no. I can do one more. Dude, can you, like, OD on pot? (man) I guess we're about to find out. [muted music] [man and woman breathing heavily] Oh, my God. How can I even think? [relaxed rock music] ? ? (Grateful Dead) ? As I was walking round Grosvenor Square, ? ? not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air. ? Wanna dance? Yes! ? From the other direction... ? With me? Denied! (Grateful Dead) ? It could be an illusion, but I might as well try. ? ? Might as well try. ? ? ? [telephone rings] beep! (man) Hello, Bickford. It's Dad. I'm still trying to reach you. It's been a couple of weeks already. I hope no news is good news, but call, okay? I don't want to have to send another search party. beep! ? ? [laughs] Busted robbing a fridge. How embarrassing. Attractive, uh... toga. Thank you. It's very me. So when they say ""toga party,"" it means you have to actually wear a toga to the party. Duh! What did you think it was? I don't know, a state of mind, like, ""Come prepared to toga."" To toga, or not to toga. Shakespeare, right? That's a good imitation. Shh. I'm going to steal this H2O. So are you having fun at the, you know, party? Oh, yeah, mad fun. You? Uh... [laughs] Not yet. I've just been on my own so far, banging my head against a brick wall metaphorically. So then your head must metaphorically hurt. Some days, yes. But Zeus had a headache, and out popped Athena, right? Goddess of wisdom. Oh, my God. Space-out. I used to know mythology. I totally loved that class. What-- oh, paranoia. Paranoia. Whoa. All right. Banzai. (The Concretes) ? You can't hurry love. ? ? ? ? You can't hurry love. ? ? ? ? You can't hurry love. ? (male voice) You shall not pass. Yow! You shall not pass. You shall not pass. Fucking righteous. [upbeat rock music] ? ? (Fuzz Townshend) ? Have you got a light for me? ? ? If so, can you get me out of this place? ? [acoustic guitar music] (man) ? Elevation far below you. ? (man) Hey, look at that guy! (man) Oh, come on. Jump, dude! (woman) Yeah, go! Isn't that the whack-job that lives in the basement? Jesus, yeah. Hey, uh, Bickford, you want to hang with us, man, away from the ledge there? (Bickford) No can do, pal. I'm not in conversational mode. I thought I was, but fuck it. What's he saying? Uh, what you talking about, Bick? The problem. I thought I could forget about it for a while and mingle, toga, whatever, but no. No dice. I'm lobe-locked. Bro, what's up with the term paper, all right? You're making us all look bad. It's not for class. The problem is just a cool idea. What is it? What's your cool idea? A unified theory of everything. It's not a big deal. [breathing heavily] Holy God, wow. Damn! So we're living in an unimaginably giant black hole. We're antimatter. And antimatter negates existence. I'm definitely matter, Einstein. Check out the gut. [laughter] All right, proof two. Subatomically, 99.99% of you is empty space, including your gut, brains, everything. So how you can assert your existence when basic physics prove that you're overwhelmingly composed of empty space? But thinking. How can you think if you don't exist? You know, I think. Therefore, I am. That works for me, man. Even Descartes believed that he was incorrect. You know what changed his mind? Did he hit the monster bong? [laughter] No, Descartes did not hit the monster bong. Better: the invention of metaphysics blew his mind, the idea that everyone experiences life solely, uniquely, impenetrably from their own point of view. No offense, bro, but all these ideas are just paradoxes. I've had deeper thoughts watching Oprah. Not that I do. (man) Who is it? It's me, Trent. Jennifer? It's Sara. Hey. Hi. Hi. Look what I liberated. What is this? Rocket fuel. Rocket fuel? [music playing in the distance] ? Going to the-- ? No. No! Is that Bick? Which one of you callous, spineless worms stole The Book? Yo, Bick, what's wrong, man? What's wrong is, some cretin at this party stole The Book. What book? Did someone steal his Bible? No, not some generic Bible, you little toga hussy. My book of cool ideas, Ralph. (man) Hey, geek boy. Go cry somewhere else, will ya? I'm no geek, you knave. And I'm not shutting up until I get The Book back. Have it your way, buzz-kill. (man) Oh, check it out. Fight, fight! (Ralph) Come on! This is my house, man. Ow! Ya! Fucking creep. What? [sighs] Shit. Help! Police! Officers, I've been raped. (man) You what? I've been raped. Geez. Where'd it happen? Oh, God. Oh, God. No, no, no, no, not raped like sexually raped. Raped like the Earth has been raped. My cool ideas, they're in this book, a notebook. Kid, kid, kid-- I live in a basement. So, what, you were not raped? (Ralph) Hey, hey! Sorry. Yeah. Hail, Caesar. [laughs] Toga party, officer. No shit. You been drinking tonight, son? Absolutely not. No, sir. Smoke a little weed? No. So if I were to pat you down, I wouldn't find any weed on you? No, sir. Not even, like, a small bud? Nope. A little roach or something? No. Shit. Damn. Hey, we found your book, man. Oh. Yeah. (Bickford) Where? Who? How? (Ralph) Some dumb jerk brought it and read it on the toilet; I don't know. Somebody found it there, like, right after you left. The toilet? Yeah. That ignorant scum. (Ralph) So thank you, officers. Seriously, really. Please, thank you. But I think we're okay now. You're all right, yeah? Okay, get him home, Brutus. Freaking college kids with their frickin' books. It's Saturday night, for Pete's sake. [laughs] Shit. Ralph, the shattered cosmos once again align. You saved my life. Thank you. Yeah, Bick, I-- I lied, man. I mean, I didn't find your book. I just-- What do you mean, you lied? You lied about the-- you lied lied? Yeah, Bick, I mean-- You lied about The Book, Ralph? You lied about The Book. I had to, Bick. We can't have cops around the house with that rager. Everyone's drinking, drunk, and I mean, God, even worse. I mean, seriously, we could get fined. Oh. Are you okay? Oh, holy shit. (Dad) It's not the end of the worlds, Bick. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Maybe this will get you to stop thinking so much and get out there and do. Out there? In there? It's all the same, and nobody gets it. I mean, I talk, and I can see it in their faces; people think I'm a lunatic. At least with The Book, I-- I've had enough of the same conversation over and over and over. I think I just need to come home. I don't think I'm ready for school. We all agreed-- you, me, the doctor-- that school would be the best next step. I know, but that decision was based on a set of facts that have changed materially, Dad, entirely. I mean, I think I just need to come home until The Book is finished, solve the thing, start from scratch. And I can't do that here, wallowing in this cesspool of soon-to-be-Deltas of the brave new world. Coming home won't bring back Mom, Bickford. beep! ""Every physical structure in the universe, ""including ourselves, is in a constant state of flux, ""minimally and maximally, continuously, continuously. ""Yet our lives are lived ""in ever-flowing still frames of reality, ""sanity being the delusion of a comfortable continuity within the vortex of infinite chaos."" ""Vortex of infinite chaos""? Come on, you've got to admit, that rules. I get it. Well, okay. Then he goes on to talk about how we're all subatomically in flux and emotionally in flux and consciously and mentally in flux. I mean, even our flux is in flux. So what? It's just that when you put all these ideas and theories and facts together and think about them all at the same time, interconnected, your brain kind of orgasms. You must be stoned off your head. No, I am telling you. This book actually made me feel these ideas-- I mean, like, tingly in my toes. 'Cause you were on a stoner safari when you found it. Like the time you watched The Seventh Seal stoned and we didn't do anything for the next month but stay in and watch stupid Swedish movies. Ingmar Bergman isn't stupid. Ha! I should just go sleep with this guy. ""Copyright Bickford Shmeckler."" What kind of sick, twistoid parents would name their kid Bickford Shmeckler? I'll ask him. Okay. You win; I'll read it. Shit, I got to get to practice. 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning? That is so not rock and roll. Yeah, well, we are not rock and roll. We're adult contemporary. There's a difference. So you really think this book is that good that you would actually bang the guy who wrote it? Yeah. But I'm a nymphomaniac. And a klepto. Hey, quit knocking my hobbies. You're their prime beneficiary. [Bickford screaming] Fucking Tarzan wanna-be motherfucker. I hope he's not down there slitting his wrists or hanging himself, you know, OD'ing on pills, something horrible like that. Dude, why are you so uptight about Dickford? He doesn't even like us. Yeah, quit being such a fag. [laughs] Pole smoker. Butt pirate. Fudge packer. Ass bandit. Ha ha. Jiz guzzler. Yuck. Dude, verbal violation. Dude, that was all net. All net, man. (man) No, you don't throw ""jiz"" out like-- Gentlemen. I found this most telltale object adjacent to the location my Tootsie Pops formerly occupied. Huh? There was an exceeding bodacious blonde at the party last night. She had a wreath-type flower thing in her hair. We conversed in the kitchen. I think she may be it, the one, the culprit. That was Sara Witt. Sara Witt? She is pretty. Sara Witt is a stone-cold fox, bro. Amen. And she's all for free. All for free? Yeah, you know. Alpha Zeta Gi? It's a sorority. Down on Washington Street? Alpha Zeta G. Washington Street. (.38 Special) ? You see it all around you, ? ? good loving gone bad. ? ? And usually it's too late ? ? when you realize what you had. ? ? So hold on loosely, ? ? but don't let go. ? ? If you cling too tightly, ? ? you're gonna... ? I am ten times more socially relevant than this geek. Sara Witt? Yeah, all right. I stopped by that sorority house thing of yours, and your friends, ""sisters,"" droogies, whatever you call them, told me I could find you here. Look, I want my book back now, all right? You are the girl who stole my book, are you not? You're Bickford Shmeckler, the man with the metaphorical headache. And thank you so much. Oh! For what? For what? God. Inspiration. God, I read your words, and look what exploded out of me. I think this is my best work ever. What's the black spot in the middle mean? That's my clitoris. It's a motif. I always put it somewhere in each of my paintings. Do you like it? Your clitoris? No, the painting, silly. It's, uh... look, Sara, I want my fucking book back, all right? I'm sorry. I'm just a little too distracted right now to do superficial stuff like look at art. Mm, well, distraction is a vibration felt in the conscious mind, sent by the subconscious, begging it to pay attention. It is a whisper from the mother of invention. That's-- One of your cool ideas? It's very bizarre to hear you say that. Trent. Meet my new friend, Bickford. Craptastic. (Sara) How could you throw it away after how much I told you it meant to me? I thought it sucked. Oh, bullshit. You're just jealous. What did you expect when you told me you'd fuck the guy who wrote it? Fuck? I didn't say it like that. (Trent) Yeah, you did, as a matter of fact. ""Ooh, ooh, his words are so orgasmic. My toes are just tingling."" Excuse him; he's an asshole. Hey, asshole man! It's not here. You positive this is the right can? Yeah, that's it. Then where's The Book? Hey, I already apologized, like, a billion times. What do you want? Justice! Come here. Whoa, whoa, hey. Just--wait. Hold on, man. Look, look, I got 200 bucks, okay? Oh, Trent, don't go there. That's mine? Take it. Just, you know, buy another notebook or diary or whatever and rewrite it. Whoa, Bick. Bick, hey, just-- wait. Ooh! This isn't about money, you smug, pretentious lemming. [grunting] Come on, Bick. I didn't know he was going to throw it away. It's not even really my fault. Let me make it up to you. Make it up to me? How? You've destroyed my life. You can't make it up to me. The Book is gone. It's gone! Gone! (Autamata) ? I'm going back where I come from. ? ? I'm going back where I come from. ? ? I'm going back to Jive County. ? ? I'm going back to Jive County. ? [phone ringing] Hello? (Bickford) Ralph? Hey, Bick. Where are you? Out partying? I'm in the basement. That's 30 feet away. Why--why are you calling me? I just didn't feel like the hike is all. I just want to express my gratitude, Ralph. Hmm? For what? I know you don't know me. I've only been here a couple weeks. But I--I appreciate the honest attempt you've made to be kind to me. But... I'm going away... for good. What do you mean, ""for good,"" Bick? I was almost finished, just looking for a way to tie it all together. [sighs] A summation, a final chapter, an end. But now I just--I feel like I'm trapped in a Moebius strip. What's a Moebius strip, Bick? An infinite looping figure eight, Ralph. Doomed to repeat the same things over and over throughout time indefinitely. It's cool, actually, if you-- never mind. I'm going away, Ralph. I'm gone. So long, pal. Bick, hey-- [dial tone] Bick. Bick. [doorbell rings] [knocking] One second! Are you Bickford Shmeckler? I'd like to speak to Sheldon Shmeckler, please. (woman) Who may I tell him who's calling? His son. [knocking at door] (Ralph) Hey, Bick, someone's here to see you. He says he knows about The Book. (Dad) Hello, Bickford. Bickford? Bickford, hello? (Ralph) Come on, Bick. Uh... (Ralph) His name's Spaceman. He's a homeless guy who hangs out in the quad and begs for quarters. Everyone knows him. He's a great Frisbee player. Thank you. We're Frisbee communicators. Right, and you have The Book? Just-- What's this? You ripped out the first page? Help us. Help us, Bickford Shmeckler. Only you could understand an extradimensional ship crashed into our temporal lobes, co-opting our sight, sound perception, our motor skills, our most basic fundaments. They give us horrible, horrible migraines. He sounds a bit like you. He's a severely delusional schizophrenic, Ralph. He is? How do you know that? Listen, Spaceman. If you have my book, I want it back. After. First. Listen. [radio static] That's free digital acoustic waves. Is that some funky shit or what? I'm lost, man. (Spaceman) Bickford Shmeckler, science and reason. You understand. To the stars we'll go. They'll go. Home. I believe this deranged person wants me to get aliens out of his head. That's it! With your help, I can expurgate these extradimensionals. Who? The aliens in his head are extradimensionals. Oh, no, no, okay. Spaceman, uh, just give me The Book back. Then I'll help you. No. Fine, no help, and you're going to give me The Book back anyway. Help us, or we'll burn it. You wouldn't dare. Try us. You wouldn't like us. I'll call the police. That won't save The Book. God! I'd say it's schizo's ball game. [faint rock music] ? ? Rob. Wait, Rob. Let's--let's-- let's talk. Let's share some thoughts. You mean, like, talk talk? Yeah, yeah. Blow my mind. Okay, cool. I can do that. Sara, you're so sexy. You're on. You're fuckably fuckalicious. You got me hot as fuck. You like talking dirty, don't you? Oh, sweet tits. No, no, no, Rob, no. Talk, I mean, like a conversation. I'll still be sexy later; I promise. I thought you said you and Trent broke up. Yeah. Yeah, I-- Rob, I--this doesn't feel right anymore. I can't do this. Sara, you're the one who wanted to make out in the first place. You seduced me. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did. I just-- I guess it's 'cause you're kind of hunky, and I thought this would be fun, but-- But what? You're not fun. I'm not fun? No, no, not at all. What do you mean? Like, my technique? Yeah, that, and also you're just-- you make my skin crawl just being you. That's devastating. Yeah. Well, sorry. (Bickford) Spaceman, regardless of how I help you interpret this random collection of scientific gobbledygook-- Gobbledygook. Yeah, regardless of what we do-- build a rocket ship, a time machine, an atomic plasma-powered slingshot-- Good. That's good, atomic plasma-- that's excellent. All right, whatever. Those aliens are never going to leave your head, because you're sick mentally. All right? You need medication. Do you mean drugs? Yes, powerful psychiatric drugs. Have you ever tried them? Peridol, Zolam, lithium, LSD, peyote. Pretty girl. Pretty girl in a doily right behind you. You. Bick. [clears throat] Contrary to what you obviously believe, I am not void of emotions. I've been feeling like crap for days. And Ralph told me about The Book and Spaceman and this whole-- Expedition. It's--this is an expedition. Right. So I just want you to know that I-- I can't express how sorry I am, not with words. Draw us a diagram. [sighs] I'm involved in a Herculean struggle for sanity here, Sara. I don't have time to deal with your pithy...pith. Quit punishing yourself for being a virgin. It's the human condition. We were all born virgins, and maybe you're just a late bloomer. I was too, you know. So that's my problem now, lack of sex? That's it? Great. Great. Thank you so much, Dr. Klepto. (Spaceman) That's his problem, definitely, sex. Who asked you? (man) Bob, you dickfor. It took me 20 minutes to set that dungeon. You guys are not going to believe this. You know Spaceman? Yeah, that dude who hangs out in the dyad? Talks to aliens. Plays Frisbee. Yes, him. Okay. He comes by the shack sometimes when I'm working, okay? I give him, you know, broken stuff like keyboards, remote controls. Anyway, he knows me, and he trusts me, right? (Doug) Bob, we're mid-battle with a lich, two Medusa, and 40 skeleton warriors. 31 skeletons. My sorceress destroyed nine with a fireball spell. Listen to me. Yesterday Spaceman comes into the shack with this book. He says he wants me to hold on to it for safekeeping, that people are after him. You know, he'll come back for it. I ask him if it's his diary. He says, no, he found it in a garbage can, doesn't want to have it on him in case Interpol comes and shakes him down, right? I had to have a peek. It's unbelievable. It's brain-melting, poetic-- it is the Communist Manifesto of cool ideas. And, therefore, what? I'm quitting the game. (Doug) Quitting? Why? For good? For the foreseeable future. You know, after reading The Book, Dungeons & Dragons just seems like a bunch of people, you know, taking on imaginary roles. That's what it is. (Bob) Yeah. But The Book, it makes life seem more interesting than D&D. [people arguing] You can't quit. Without your elfin rogue-illusionist, we're never going to make it to the next level. You're--he's carrying the Wand of the Crimson Magi. If you're out, I'm stealing that wand. (woman) You cannot grave rob. Yes, he can. He's chaotic neutral. (Bob) Read The Book, people. If you don't agree that it is a veritable classic that, but for the grace of God, whose existence The Book debates rather interestingly, was saved from oblivion by Spaceman picking garbage, I will--I will... I'll buy you, each one of you, a ticket for next week's Buffy and Xena convention. I'm reading The Book. Dibs on Buffy. Xena. I'll get both of them. Let's do it. You totally wish. Just read The Book. (Bickford) The Moon is 238,857 miles from Earth. With the right lens, it looks like you could just reach out and touch it. What I want you to do is turn that telescopic view inside your mind. I want you to get a good beat on those aliens. I want you to see them and that extradimensional spaceship of theirs. I want--I want you to reach in and flick them. You can't just flick a spaceship. It's too heavy. And the trajection wouldn't even be accurate. The theory of metalunar clairvoyant projection is bunk. Spaceman, I have been ueberpatient with you, all right? But I've had it. I've had it! Had it, had it, had it, had it, all right? And I've come to a decision that as far as I can see is the only cogent way out of this predicament for me. I want my book returned now, or I will kill you. Do you understand that? Even your strange brain can surely access the instinct of self-preservation, man. Use it. If I give you your book back, you'll abandon us, like everyone else has abandoned us. Fine! Fine! Fine, fine! All right, that's fine. That's okay. That's that, then. The next time you see me, I'll be stabbing you to death, all right? All of you. [over bullhorn] Bickford Shmeckler, we need your help. You have to help us! Please don't leave us, Bickford! (Bob) Tired of thinking the same old shit? Read The Book. Are you looking for a new adventure? Read The Book. Look your mind's eye right in the face. Get inspired. It's free. Tired of the same old shit? Take a copy, comrade. The revolution begins in your imagination. You don't say. I do. Get inspired. Are you looking for a new adventure? Are you tired of thinking the same old shit? Oh, take a copy, brother. Oh, you look a lost soul who could use it. I'm busy. Move. Take a copy. It's free. It tickles the frontal lobe. Dude, dude. Damn it. Dude! The world doesn't need any more self-important student poets. Ha ha, that's fucking-- cock. Ah, I don't know. You were strong. Yeah. Good one. Good one. Watch this special move. crash! (Bickford) What's that doing there, P.J.? Jesus Christ, clean your shit up. [clattering] Where are the butcher knives? I don't think we have any. [Bickford screams] There's some steak knives in the drawer. Steak knives are too small! [triumphantly] Ha! This is perfect, it's fearsome. Wait, wait, wait. Bick, you're not thinking of-- what are you thinking? You wouldn't know it to look at me, Ralph, but I'm a murderer, a cold-blooded axman. Desperate times call for desperate measures. If Spaceman doesn't give me The Book back, I swear to God-- Okay, whoa, whoa, Bick! Bick, whoa! Slow, slow. Do the math, all right? Now-- Ha! You threaten Spaceman with that turkey fork, right? You ask him for The Book, and he refuses. And he will refuse, because he's deranged. What then? Then he gets a free tracheotomy. And The Book? What about The Book? What about The Book? He's the only person who knows where it is. You'll never find it again. And you'll go to jail. It's a credible threat, Ralph. Mutual assured destruction. If it helped to stop a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, surely Spaceman's going to understand that-- Spaceman isn't going to understand shit. No, he won't. Goddamn tyranny of logic. [doorbell rings] Hello. Hello. Hi. I'm Trent Masterton to see Sara Witt. Hmm. You're Trent. The poser boyfriend. She called me a poser? Among other things. Also a four-letter word for... [together] Penis. Okay, all right. Is Sara in or not? [together] Maybe. Okay, well, could you at least make sure she gets this? Please? What's in it? None of your beeswax. Is it expensive? Looks good. Let me see. Hey, can you give the box to Sara, please? Sure. We'll get it to her. Take care. Bye-bye. Hey! She better get that gift! Did you know that the Sun is going to implode and take out the entire solar system and all of humanity with it? Ideas like that make me feel sexy. Then you gotta read this book. [lively acoustic guitar music] ? ? [beeping] ? ? [clears throat] Excuse me. Does one use a withdrawal, a deferment, or an incomplete form if one is flipping out and one needs some time to get one's head together and one doesn't want to stick his dad with a useless tuition bill? You mean you need a medical leave? Maybe. ? ? (Frank Black) ? Out on the Eisenhower, where I lost my speed, ? ? just a little bit south of a town called Weed, ? ? I heard a voice, and I had to stop. ? ? She called me over that mountain top. ? ? I was a poor soul lost in the shady trees. ? ? I was going to die. I was going to freeze. ? ? Then she touched me. ? ? She was velvety. ? ? ? ? She's a cat of a creature. ? ? She don't care. ? ? She's velvety. ? ? She made the strangest sounds. ? [laughs] (Bob) Read The Book. Take it. Put it in your cranium. Look your mind's eye right in the face, huh? What does it mean? Read The Book. Read The Book, buddy. Read The Book. Come on, people. Read it. Hey, read The Book! The Book? No. (man) May I help you? Popsicle? Malt cup? Frog on a stick. Laced! That asshole laced my stuff! Help! Hey, I need help. I am... hallucinating. Call 911. Our senses work in spectrums, all right? Take sight, for example. Your eyes can only see energy in the visible light spectrum. Those colors you can see are only an infinitesimal fraction of the energy spectrums that actually exist. It's the same with sound, taste, smell, touch, everything. We exist in this narrow band of perception. All right? It makes something as simple as just thinking clearly, frankly, impossible. That's why you're withdrawing from school, because of this, what, cosmic intruding stuff? Well, I mean, there are other mitigating factors, but those are harder to explain. [sighs] Okay. Bickford. I think I know why you're upset, and it's got nothing to do with your book. All right. Enlighten me. I mean, I've had feelings of loneliness too, you know, and anxiety or just hate. Hate? And I have to tell you. I feel safe in telling you, okay, that-- you look at yourself in the mirror, okay? Really look closely. I bet--I bet you see someone who looks a lot, emotionally, like me. Someone who's gay. [sighs] You're gay? Oh, yeah. Haven't you ever noticed that some guys just look really, really good? You think that I'm... like you? Why not? There's millions of us. Come on. No, there are millions. We're not alone. Ralph, uh... [telephone ringing] I wasn't born in the way that I would have to be born to do the things that you're proposing. beep! (Sara) Bick, it's Sara, the klepto. I should-- You're not going to believe this, but I found your book. Oh, I'm sorry, Ralph. I've got to get that. Sara? It's Bick. Where are you? Oh. Uh, can we use your car to go pick Sara up from the hospital? The hospital? [acoustic guitar music] ? ? (Beck) ? Lazy flies all hovering above. ? ? The magistrate, he puts on his gloves, ? ? and he looks to the clouds, ? ? all pink and disheveled. ? ? There must be some blueprints, ? ? some creed of the devil inscribed in our minds, ? ? a hideous game. ? ? Vanishes in thin air, the vanity of slaves. ? ? Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, ? ? to harness dead horses, to ride in the sun? ? ? A life of confessions written in the dust. ? ? ? ? Out in the mangroves, the mynah birds cry. ? ? In the shadows of sulfur, the trawlers drift by. ? ? They're chewing dried meat in a house of disrepute. ? ? The dust of opiates and syphilis patients ? ? on brochure vacations. ? ? Fear has a glare ? ? that traps you like searchlights. ? ? The puritans stare. ? ? Their souls are fluorescent. ? ? The skin of a robot vibrates with pleasure. ? ? Matrons and gigolos carouse in the parlor. ? ? Their hand-grenade eyes... ? Look, if it's any consolation, I haven't stolen anything in days. Well, only one thing, but that was for art. And I'm giving up pot too... for a while, at least until the end of the semester. And then maybe I'll try it again. Well, I'm glad my misery has had such a positive effect on your life. You're my hero. It seems all here. You like her, don't you? Sara? I mean, she's-- she's a knockout. You should go for it. I mean, that. You should-- She totally violated me, Ralph. I mean, she utterly destroyed any confidence I could ever have in her, although she does keep kissing me, which is, frankly, pretty cool. ""Keeps""? What do you mean, ""keeps""? Like, she kissed you like that, like what I just saw, before? Yes, once. Only this time, it was more lingering, and she threw in some tongue. Pleasant surprise. Her body is astounding. Her mind is, like, perky, you know? Listen, Ralph, I'm sorry I'm not, like you said, one of the millions. Don't--stop--please--I-- [laughs] I would have just broken your heart anyway, Bickford. (Bob Dylan) ? Well, I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? Yeah, I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? Well, I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? My feet'll be a-flyin' ? ? to tell you 'bout my troubled mind. ? ? On the corner was a man. ? ? On the corner was a man. ? ? On the corner was a man, a shotgun in his hand, ? ? and I really didn't understand. ? ? That's why I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? Well, I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? Well, I'm walkin' down the line. ? ? My feet'll be a-flyin'... ? [scoffs] Hello? Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? Uh, you got it. Look, I'm Bickford Shmeckler. I'm ""Anonymous."" I know this guy. I know this guy. You're the-- you're the poet-hater guy who hangs out in the quad with Spaceman, right? Poet-hater, no. I'm a poet fan, believe you me. And I'm the author of this book you scofflaws have been distributing. You wrote The Book? He wishes. Yes, I wrote The Book. I can prove it. I believe the book in your possession is missing its first page. Let me see that. It's the same handwriting. Whoa. Bickford Shmeckler? You're him? You're the guy. You're the guy. I thought you'd be more... Abbie Hoffman. Yeah. Want to hear some of our cool ideas? We got about nine pag-- No? Okay. They're not, you know, as cool as yours, but-- They're still fairly intensely thought-provoking and mildly pleasurable. (Bob) We're more... sociopolitical, I guess. But, you know, in the tradition of the great book. If I could just lay this on you, if I may. ""Governments derive their power from the masses, ""but when disenfranchised voters turn against the institutions, which vest power in authority""-- Listen, numbskull. That sort of ""we, the people"" rap went out with Ben Franklin. I'm the one with the cool ideas here, and you people are infringing on my copyrights. I want my book back now. Plus, I insist you dimwits cease and desist distributing my book immediately. Anything less, and I'll return to your little shop here with a gas can and a box of matches. Listen, you don't understand. We're your biggest fans. Yeah. (man) Yeah. This shop is ground zero for the reality revolution. Reality r-- (Bickford) All right, all right. That's it. I'm taking all this stuff-- hats and T-shirts. What the hell are those? ""Reality isn't"" shot glasses. Shot glasses? You people are hopeless. (Bob) You know what? Here. You're not even cool. Yeah, you're just some arrogant loser who doesn't even comprehend merchandising. Get this guy a box. Take all this crap out of here. I can't believe I quit D&D for you, man. D&D? I had the Wand of the Crimson Magi, but it doesn't matter. Hey, Slim, hand me those mugs. Gave it up for you, but whatever. Why don't you get out? Take it. Take it and get out. Why don't you leave the store? How about that? Whoa. Dork. (Violent Femmes) ? I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N. ? ? I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N. ? ? I'm nothing. I'm nothing. ? ? Are you a Republican or a Democrat, ? ? a liberal fascist full of crap? ? ? I'm nothing. I'm nothing. ? ? Somebody somewhere might be something, ? ? but everybody everywhere knows that I'm nothing. ? ? ? ? Politics and dirty tricks. ? ? I got no time for stones and sticks. ? ? Politics and dirty tricks. ? ? I got no time. I'm chasing chicks. ? ? I'm nothing. I'm nothing. ? ? Somebody somewhere might be something, ? ? but everybody everywhere knows that I'm nothing. ? ? ? ? I'm nothing. I'm like a cloud. ? ? I'm free to be alone in a crowd. ? ? What's your reality? ? ? It's not real to me. ? ? What's your anomaly? ? ? It is my destiny. ? ? ? ? I-M-N-O-T-H-I-N. ? ? I'm nothing. ? ? Nothing. ? ? Nothin'. ? Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Wrong. (Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings) ? Let 'em talk. ? ? I don't care if it's right. ? ? You see, the hour's getting late. ? ? ? ? If those two lips are gonna resist me, ? ? you better come on, boy, come on over here ? ? and kiss me, yeah. ? [woman clears throat] Before we get started, is Bickford Shmeckler in class today? Bickford Shmeckler, are you here? [man laughs] Bickford Shmeckler. Present. Will you please come see me after the lecture? [students giggling] Okay. Great. (man) Where are you off to now? All right, I'll see you over there. Professor Adams. Bickford Shmeckler. I did some research and discovered the anonymous young man who wrote this remarkable book was none other than one of my very own students. Bickford. I had no idea anyone was paying attention-- not in an undergraduate class, anyway, not at a level so penetrating, profound, dare I say passionate? Uh, Professor Adams. Your class has nothing to do with why I wrote The Book. I know all this fundamental stuff already. I need the credits to graduate. I know. I'm pulling your leg. I enjoyed your work so much, I took the liberty of passing it on to a publisher friend of mine in New York. What? No, you didn't. Yes, I did. No. Yeah, he loves it, and he wants to fly out here to meet you. I think he wants to publish you. And what exactly does that mean? Well, it means that you owe me a very, very big favor. You fascinate me. [tropical music] ? ? All right, there it is. There it is. Yup, there it is. Oh, yeah. Get a good one. Tip it. Did you get it? Ooh, yeah. Yeah? Yeah? Taste the juice? Pineapple. Citrusy. That's it. Hey, Bick, want to join the party? Eh. ""Eh."" The genie's out of the bottle. The Book's out there, way out there. Everything is becoming extremely tight, closing in. You know Professor Adams? You're not going to believe-- Bick. I'm all tapped out of compassion. You got your book back, man. Your nightmare, it's over. Move on, please. But you, I thought, were my friend. Yeah, yeah, and as your friend, I'm telling you, just be happy. But happiness isn't just a switch in your head that you can flip on at will. Yes, it is. Happiness is a switch? That's so... masturbatory. Well, isn't masturbation one of the greatest inventions of all time? Ralph, come on. I'm in crisis mode here. All right. What's masturbatory is thinking all those heavy thoughts all day long. There is no need to be so intense about everything, Bick. You're living your book too much. No, you just got to flip that switch and take some time and just--just chill. [sighs] Believe me; you need it, pal. I'll catch you later. [rapping] You disappeared on us. Yeah. Yeah, I constantly disappear and reappear. It's a thing I do subatomically. Yeah. It's happened several times in this conversation already, but it happened so fast, you couldn't perceive it. How are the extradimensionals? The extradimensionals need you back. They want us to rescue them from the misery. You can save us. We need you to solve the problem. You never call. You never write. And then you just show up out of the blue. You really are cultivating that whole mysterious guy thing, aren't you? I--I just need to talk to someone. [women giggling] Okay, secret agent man. What's the rumpus? I, uh... I think a publishing company in New York wants to buy The Book as-is. Wait, wait, wait, rewind. Buy it? You mean publish The Book? Yeah, I don't know-- I don't know all the details. Some guy wants to meet me. He's flying out from New York. Bick, that is so cool! Yeah. That is cool, isn't it? I'm sorry. I need to go. Bick, what is wrong? Why did you even come here in the first place? I, uh... Whatever it is, it can't be that bad, can it? I killed my mom, Sara. What, honey? I can't sell The Book. I only started it because of my mom. You killed her? No. How? With a butcher's knife? A butcher's knife? Ralph told me about your episode with the turkey fork, and-- I killed my mom with a car, Sara. The car flipped four times. My mom died the next day at the hospital, the other driver instantly. And... I didn't suffer a scratch. It sounds like that accident wasn't even close to being your fault. That's what I told myself. I was stoic to the bone. After a while, I guess you could say I got deluded. I thought that people thought I was speaking gibberish, and when I heard them speak, they just sounded like shallow, petty idiots. Well, that wasn't your imagination, Bick. People can be shallow, petty idiots. It got so bad, I couldn't leave my apartment. My textbooks would talk and sing to me. And food in the refrigerator would become these, like, wild cartoons. Trip out. And there was a knock at the door. It was my dad and some doctor guy from a mental institution and a cop trained in the handling of psychotic individuals. They forced you... To a looney bin. Yeah. And that, Sara, I have never told anyone. And they gave me a notebook, so I wrote. And the more I wrote, the more refined my thoughts became. [sighs] Six weeks later, they let me out. And a month after that, I showed up to school relaxed, rested, and ready for action. And then you stole my book. I'm so sorry. I just--I loved it. And I'm so glad you got it back. I'm going to end up like Spaceman. [laughs] No, I am. Like Spaceman, homeless on some college campus, collecting recyclables, begging for quarters, and trying to expurgate extradimensionals from my head. No, you're not mentally ill, Bick. Not like that, not even close. You're just... an anxious, self-absorbed perfectionist, all good qualities under different circumstances. You know what you need? An end to The Book? No. A new beginning. (man) Da-da-da-dum. This contract contains the terms we're willing to offer, including a $20,000 advance against royalties, a 10,000-copy first printing, and a guarantee to market the book accordingly. There's an awful lot of fine print. [laughs] Well, that's because we mean business. Sir, the only reason that I'm here is because-- well, there's this girl who thought I would be a fool not to meet you. He has a girlfriend. Yeah, he's informed me. Well, I just want to say, from the start, The Book isn't finished. Oh, of course. No, it could use some editing. But, Bickford, I want you to understand I don't expect you to sign anything here and now. Take the contract home. Show it to your mom and dad, a lawyer. You could even have a law student friend review it pro bono. [laughter] Ah, I find this collegiate atmosphere very invigorating. I also think, if you'll forgive me for being so forward-- but, hey, that's why I'm paid the big bucks-- you may want to give some thought to finding a title other than The Book for the book. Yeah. It's--well, it's a tad pretentious. And I fear people may mistake it for some kind of religious text. How about Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas? 'Cause you're Bickford, and it's your cool ideas. Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas. I like it. [dog barks] (Sara) You know, Bick, if I'm reading this correctly, when the book goes into second printing, if it does, you could make out like a bandit. [groans] I just can't stop thinking this is a bad idea. [sighs] It'd be dedicated to your mother. Yeah, and she's really, what, going to enjoy spending the royalty checks? [sighs] You know, Bick, you should put a warning label on your book. ""Author full of a shit and doesn't understand one word of what he wrote."" Where are you going? Oh, does it matter? I'm not even in this dimension, right? Are you breaking up with me? [laughs] After six days, it's not called ""breaking up,"" Bick. It's called using your head and steering clear. You're dumping me because I won't sell out to the lemmings. How could you, of all people, be that materialistic? I couldn't care less about the money, Bick. You've written The Book. It's finished. It has been since I met you. So deal with it. Misery may love company, but I don't. I like fun. ""Author full of shit."" ""Author full of shit."" ""Warning. Warning: Author full of shit."" Huh? Tell me, stranger, do you doubt that you exist standing there, listening to my voice? Uh, no? Of course not. Because, ultimately, that horny little artist girl is right. I've been thinking my brain fried for two years, and now where am I? Nowhere. You hear that, God? I've seen through your secret plan. No matter how smart, how clever we all think we are, ultimately, we all know, I know nothing. Shit. There is no theory of everything. We know nothing. And anyone who thinks they need to know every single goddamn thing is a... dipshit. If I let that girl walk out of my life-- You're the dipshit? [laughter] I'm the dipshit. [cheers and applause] (Bob) ""Warning: Read at your own risk. ""The following ideas are dangerous and addictive. ""Repeated use can induce insomnia, delusional fantasy, ""fits of libidinous frustration, and other psychiatric conditions."" Yeesh. ""When reading, place feet firm to the ground, ""tongue firm to cheek, ""and fasten your mental safety belt tightly. ""Above all, remember that as the fabric of reality ""begins to rip around you ""and uneasy feelings overtake your sense of self, breathe deep and have fun."" Having fun-- pure, unadulterated, high-octane physical sensation. It's, like, the most important thing, and I forgot that. So you're just giving us The Book? On one condition: that you keep giving it away for free. I don't want anybody to profit off of it. That's not The Book. Which means, no merchandising. Sorry, Bob. Well, I don't know-- Douche bag. You see, he's got a contract. The guy's blowing 20 grand on us. [whispers] So zip it. I don't get it. Why would you give us The Book when it is obviously your life's work? Yeah. All I can say is, in the last couple weeks, I had a life-changing, quasipsychedelic epiphany. And I got my fun back. I had one of those, uh-- I had one of those epiphanies reading The Book. But if you had one of those epiphanies and you wrote the book-- Oh, oh, that's a good one. Oh, yeah. [breathes heavily] What's wrong with them? Brain-gasm. (Doug) That's the main reason right there that The Reality Isn't Club was ten times more popular than Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ever was. This response actually happens when people read The Book? Ga! Ha! Sometimes. How utterly curious. Just stop talking one moment, please. (woman) You didn't know that happened? (Bickford) I had no idea. I didn't intend for people to ever read The Book. But it escaped. It had a will of its own, I guess. [people gasping] Whoa. So do we have a deal or what? You betcha. [lively rock music] ? ? (Dressy Bessy) ? My dear, I've painted a picture. ? ? I've painted a picture for the questioned wall. ? ? I'll hang it up with the rest soon, ? ? right up with the next few that come along. ? ? One more. ? ? There's room for just more. ? ? Once more, make room for just one more. ? Dad, it's Bick. I had sex. (Dad) You had sex. Yeah, a bunch of times. I never knew what I was missing. Hmm. The human body is the most marvelous thing. Well, that's good news, I guess. And you're being-- what's the expression--safe? Uh, yeah. And everything else is okay. Everything's awesome. Fundamentally. That's awesome that it's awesome. I gotta go. Okay. Bye, Bick. (Sara) What are you writing? An epic poem. An epic sex poem. About you. It's kind of a sequel to The Book. Is it a porno? [laughs] Yes. [laughs] But it's going to be smart and crazy subversive. Ooh, I like crazy subversive. (Simon & Garfunkel) ? Slow down. You move too fast. ? ? You got to make the moment last. ? ? Just kicking down the cobblestones, ? ? looking for fun and feeling groovy. ? ? Ba da-da da da da da, feeling groovy. ? ? ? ? Hello, lamppost. ? ? Whatcha knowing? ? ? I've come to watch your flowers growin'. ? ? Ain't ya got no rhymes for me? ? [electricity crackling] ? Ba da-da da da da da, feeling groovy. ? Ah hoo! ?

Bringing Up Baby (1938) - full transcript,"While trying to secure a $1 million donation for his museum, a befuddled paleontologist is pursued by a flighty and often irritating heiress and her pet leopard, Baby.","Good morning, Miss Swallow. - Why, what's the matter? - Dr. Huxley is thinking. Alice, I think this one must belong in the tail. Nonsense. You tried it in the tail yesterday and it didn't fit. Yes, that's right. I did, didn't I? David, it's a telegram for you from Utah. It's from the expedition. The expedition! Open it. I'll be right down. David, they found it! They found it, David! Not the intercostal clavicle? It's on its way. It'll be here tomorrow. Just think of it, Professor. The very last bone we needed to complete the brontosaurus. The intercostal clavicle is arriving tomorrow after four years' hard work. - Congratulations, my boy. - Isn't it great? I can hardly believe it! Stop it. Really, David, there's a time and place for everything. What will Prof. LaTouche think? After all, you're getting married tomorrow. - Yes, I know we are... - Right, we're getting married tomorrow. Isn't that odd? Two important things happening on the same day. I think the occasion calls for a celebration. Don't worry, we'll celebrate. We're going away directly after we're married. Going away? What are you thinking of, David? After receiving this telegram? As soon as we're married, we're coming directly back here... - and you're going on with your work. - Alice. Now, once and for all, David, nothing must interfere with your work. Our marriage must entail no domestic entanglements of any kind. - You mean... - I mean of any kind, David. Alice, I was sort of hoping... You mean children, all that sort of thing? Exactly. This will be our child. Yes, David, I see our marriage purely as a dedication to your work. Alice, everybody has to have a honeymoon and... We haven't time. You have an appointment this afternoon. - Have I? What for? - To play golf with Mr. Peabody. What Peabody? The Alexander Peabody who represents Mrs. Carleton Random. Now let me think. Who may donate $1 million to the museum to complete all this. Oh, sure! That Mr. Peabody. $1 million. That's pretty white of Mr. Peabody. You haven't got it yet. Let me remind you that a lot depends on the impression you make on him. Don't worry. After I've received this, I feel good for anything. I'll wow him, I'll knock him for a loop. David, no slang. Remember who and what you are. - That's right. - Go on. You mustn't keep him waiting. - Goodbye, Alice. I mean, Professor. - Don't forget your golf clubs. Remember, let Mr. Peabody win. Yes, Alice. I will. Oh, dear. Excuse me. I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody... how much this endowment would mean to the museum... and to me personally. If you could just give me some assurance... If you could give me some assurance that you'd... consider us first before you donate that million to anyone else, I'd appreciate it. Dr. Huxley, you seem to be under some misapprehension. I haven't got $1 million. I represent the possible donor, Mrs. Carleton Random... whose legal advisor I happen to be. Yes, of course. I forgot. Mr. Peabody, then I wonder... if you could use your influence with Mrs. Random, that would be nice. Dr. Huxley, when I play golf, I only talk golf... - and then only between shots. - Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Couldn't we continue this discussion over a whisky and soda after our game? Yes, we could. Meantime, I believe you hooked your ball. Yes, I did. I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody. Yes. All right. Look! You can't... That's my ball. Just a minute! Here's hoping. I say, just a minute. I beg your pardon. Oh, dear. - You shouldn't do that, you know. - What shouldn't I do? Talk while someone's shooting. Anyway, I forgive you because I got a good shot. - You don't understand. - It's right next to the pin. That has nothing to do with it. - You playing through? - I've just teed off. You must be a stranger here. You should be over there. This is the 18th fairway and I'm on the green. If I sink this, I'll beat my record. Be there in a minute! What kind of ball are you playing? - PGA. - I'm playing a CrowFlight. I like a PGA better. I'm trying to prove that you're playing my ball. A PGA has two black dots, and a CrowFlight has a circle. I'm not superstitious. - That has nothing to do with it. - Stop talking and take out the pin. Oh, my, this is so silly. See? It's a circle. Of course. Do you think it would roll if it were square? I have reference to a mark on the ball. That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine. What does it matter? It's only a game, anyway. Young lady, you don't seem to realize... you've placed me in a very embarrassing position. Really? I'm sorry. The most important lawyer in New York is waiting for me on the first fairway. Then it's silly of you to be fooling around on the 18th green. You don't mind if I take this with me? Not at all. Tell the caddy master to put it in my bag when you're finished. Huxley, come on! Yes, I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody! Hey, mister, I think that's your car. I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody! What do you think you're doing? I'm trying to un-park my car. - Oh, hello. - This is my car! Good. Would you mind moving it out of the way? - No. This is my car. - Yes, I understand that. If you move it back four feet, I'll be able to get out. I'm afraid you've made a mistake. Maybe this is yours. What did you say? I said if you move it back about four feet, I'll be able to get out. I'm in a terrible hurry, and I can't budge. - You want me to move your car? - Would you mind terribly? - Yes, I will, but... - That would be awfully kind. - Take it very easy. - Yes, I'll go slowly. What are you doing? I have to get into position. Please be careful. I will. Now, you say when. - Yes, all right. - Am I clear? Yes, you're clear now. - Now look what you've done. - That's all right. I'm insured. I don't care whether you're insured or not! Let me drive this car. It's all right. It's an old wreck, anyway. It doesn't matter. You don't understand. This is my car! - You mean this is your car? - Of course. Your golf ball, your car? Is there anything in the world that doesn't belong to you? Yes, thank heaven. You! Now, don't lose your temper. Young lady, I'm not losing my temper. I'm merely trying to play some golf. You choose the funniest places. This is a parking lot. Will you get out of my car? - Get off my running board. - This is my running board! All right, honey, stay there. Help me! Don't think everything in the world is yours. This is my car, I'll handle it. If you want to come with me, go ahead. I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody! Good evening, sir. I'm looking for Mr. Alexander Peabody. I believe he's dining here. Mr. Peabody has not arrived yet. Is that so? Well, I'll just wait. - Yes, sir. - Good evening, Louis. - Good evening, Mr. Brown. Right this way. - Thank you. May I check your hat, sir? - Excuse me? - Check your hat? No, I better... Maybe you'd... I'm sorry. Look at that. I dropped my hat. I'd better hang on to it. - Now, watch very carefully. - I'm watching. I take an olive, I throw it in that glass, but there it is. - Now I throw it in that one. - Wait. Now, without the... Go on. Watch. I know what happens. That's wonderful. You take three, don't you? Only you cheated. You can see me take three. You throw it in the glass. Take another one, throw it. - Good! - And then you do this. I'm so sorry. Oh, hello. You're sitting on your hat. - I know it. - That's silly. Get up. I'm awfully sorry. I couldn't be more apologetic, really. Well, I might have known you were here. I had a feeling just as I hit the floor. That was your hat. Look at it. Look. Yes, it's too bad, isn't it? Joe here was showing me a trick, and the olive got away. First you drop an olive, then I sit on my hat. It all fits perfectly. You can't do that trick without dropping some of the olives. It takes practice. What, to sit on my hat? No, to drop an olive. Now, if you're going to be angry with me, what can I do? Go away. No. I was here first. - Then I'll go away. - What, you... Won't you just take the olive dish? No, it's all right. I'll sit here. You don't mind, do you? - Not at all. - This is rather difficult. - I guess it is. - Goodness. Your face is familiar. Haven't we met somewhere? Not to my knowledge. You're wrong. My name's Susan Vance. I'm Dr. Fritz Lehman. That's all right. You can sit down. I don't mind at all. - You may have heard me lecture. - What do you lecture about? I usually talk about nervous disorders. I am a psychiatrist. Oh, crazy people. We dislike the use of that word. All people who behave strangely are not insane. Is that so? Would you mind if I asked your professional opinion about something? Not at all. What would you say about a man who follows a girl around... and then when she talks to him, he fights with her? Fights with her? Is the young man your fianc?? No. I don't know, I never even saw him before today. No, he just follows me around and fights with me. The love impulse in man very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict. The love impulse? Without my knowing anything about it... my rough guess would be that he has a fixation on you. A fixation... Wait a minute, I can't remember more than that. A fixation? ""The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict."" - That's right. - I'm eternally grateful to you. You're absolutely wonderful. Thank you very much. Do you know why you're following me? You're a fixation. I'm not following you. I haven't moved from this spot. Please, you're following me. Don't be absurd. Who's always behind whom? My dear young lady, I haven't been behind anything... but what they call the eight ball. I haven't been all day. - You're angry, aren't you? - Yes, I am. The love impulse in man frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict. - Excuse me. The what impulse? - Love impulse. The trouble with you is that you have a... Look, all I'm trying to do... is find the gentleman whom, thanks to you... I abandoned on the golf course today. That's all. Now please go... Say, this isn't... Where do you suppose I... - Hold this a minute. I'll be right back. - Yes. Missed. - I'm sorry I was so long. - It's quite all right. I had a very entertaining conversation with a young lady who does tricks... with olives when she gets it right. Fritz, where's my purse? I thought you had it with you. No, I left it right here on the table. - My diamond pin was in it. - Your diamond pin? You just lost a diamond pin. We're going to find it, all right? - Don't worry about it. - Excuse me. Why, there it is. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you. - Thank you. - Why, no. This is my purse. My diamond pin is in it. - Will you please... - No, I'm afraid... - Give me that. - Will you please hand it over? - Do something about it. - Keep out of it, darling. - I did the trick. - You did? Good. It is madness for you to say it's not my wife's. You've made a slight blunder. This belongs... There is the young lady. Isn't this your purse? - No, this is my purse. - There you are. Hand it over. Just a minute. Didn't you give me this purse to hold? Yes, that's right, I did. I gave him the purse to hold. There's been a mistake. I lost my purse. I must've picked up your wife's purse by mistake. I wanted him to stay here, so I gave him this purse... while I went to find mine. I was coming back. - Now, that's all perfectly clear, isn't it? - No, it isn't. - She's going to give me an explanation. - No! My dear sir, it never will be clear as long as she's explaining it. - Now please let me go. - Just a minute. He's innocent. Now you have your wife's purse, I have my purse... and Louie will explain it all to you and everything will be all right. Please listen. You can't think I did that intentionally. If I could think, I'd have run when I saw you. If you'd only let me explain. I just gave you my purse to... You've torn your coat. Now, I didn't do it on purpose. That's not right. It's not my fault. I did it, but I didn't mean to do it. I just caught hold of your coat. Will you do something for me? A needle? No, it's simpler than that. Let's play a game. What? Watch. I'll put my hand over my eyes, and then you go away. See? Then I'll count to 10, and when I take my hand down... you will be gone. One... I like that. I was only trying to be nice. Thank you. Just a minute! You can't talk to me that way then crawl out of it. - When I'm mad, I'm mad. - Something horrible has happened. Don't tell me about it. Just get out of it as best you can. Please stop following me around, fixation or no fixation. I've had enough. - Stop talking, so I can tell you... - Will you stop crowding me? - I'm just trying to tell you, you've torn... - No, I didn't. - If you'd waited for my explanation... - Not my coat... ...your coat would still be very all right. - What is the matter with you? - You see, I... Do you realize you're making a fool out of yourself? You can't tell me I tore your coat. There's such a thing as being fair. Will you please stop doing that with your hat? Just stand there, will you? What in the world is going on? - No! Please don't move! - I've had enough of this. Listen to me. Let's get out of here. Just start walking. So now you want to walk. Well, I'm quite sure that I don't want to walk with you. I hope you realize that you've made a perfect spectacle of yourself. Have you finished? - Yes. - Thank you. Don't just stand there. Do something. Oh, my goodness. Get behind me. - I am behind you. - Get closer. I can't get any closer. Are you ready? Be calm. Left foot first. - Go straight out the door. - I have to meet someone here. There he is. Don't you dare leave me. I'll be with you in a minute, sir. It's very important that I meet this man to explain to him what happened... although if I saw him, I wouldn't know what to say. It's perfectly simple. Tell him you met someone you knew and were detained. I can picture myself explaining our exit from the Ritz Plaza to Mr. Peabody. It's not Boopie that you're trying to see? No. His name's Peabody. Alexander Peabody. But that's Boopie, and I know him well. I was going to have supper with him tonight. He'll do anything I ask. - Let's go to the Ritz and catch him. - I'd better go there alone. If we miss him there, we'll go out to Riverdale. There you are. - I couldn't spend that much time. - Riverdale's only half an hour away. Yes, but I have to go to Carnegie Hall to meet Miss Swallow. - Miss Swallow? - Yes. I'm engaged to Miss Swallow. Engaged to be married? - That's right. - That's nice. - Then she won't mind waiting, will she? - I wouldn't like to... If I were engaged to you, I wouldn't mind waiting at all. - I'd wait for ever. - But it wouldn't be right. - I finally got you here, didn't I? - Yes. Susan, do they build all the houses in Riverdale alike? I don't think so. Why? Because if they don't, we've passed this one six times in the last hour. But it was such a lovely night for a drive. Come on. Oh, dear. There aren't any lights. Mr. Peabody must have gone to bed. No, he couldn't have gone to bed this soon. It's early. If they expected you, they could, with the covers over their heads. If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you arrange matters with Boopie. I've a feeling it might be better if you didn't. - Why? - I don't think we ought to do this, Susan. If we wake him up, he'll be irritable. I don't think it's gonna work, but I know where Boopie sleeps. You can't climb in a man's bedroom window. I know. It's on the second floor. Please, it's too late now. You can't wake him up. Can't I? What are you doing? - Pebbles. - What for? If you throw pebbles against a window, people think it's hail... and then they come and close the window. I know we ought to go now, but somehow I can't move. I guess they weren't big enough. Why not... What? - Here's a pip. - Just a minute! Jeepers! Let's get out of here. Don't worry, everything's going to be all right. Tomorrow, when Boopie's calmed down, we'll go and see him together. Now, just a moment. Don't think that I don't appreciate all you've done... It was nothing, David... Just a moment. But there are limits to what a man can bear. Besides, tomorrow afternoon I'm going to get married. What for? Because... Anyway, I'm going to get married, and don't interrupt. Now, my future wife has always regarded me as a man of some dignity. Privately, I'm convinced that I have some dignity. Now, it isn't that I don't like you, Susan... because after all, in moments of quiet, I'm strangely drawn towards you... but there haven't been any quiet moments. Our relationship has been a series of misadventures... from beginning to end. So if you don't mind, I'll see Mr. Peabody alone and unarmed. Without me? Yes, without you, and definitely without you. Now, Susan, I'm going to say goodnight. And I hope that I never set eyes on you again. Goodnight. Yes, I did see Mr. Peabody, but I didn't see him. That is, I didn't see him really. Yes, I spoke to him twice, but I didn't talk to him. But I don't understand. Did you see him or didn't you? No, I don't know. How do I know? Because... There's someone at the door. You see, there are some things that are very hard to explain, Alice... and as soon as I... Yes, Alice. Now, Alice, before we're married this afternoon... there's one thing we must have clear. I don't want any woman interfering with my affairs. It's fatal. That's the stuff, buddy. - What do you want? - Dr. Huxley? Sign here. Just a minute, Alice. I have to sign something. Alice, it's arrived! The intercostal clavicle. Yes, isn't that wonderful? Isn't that a marvelous wedding present? Thank you. You see, I'm going to be married this afternoon. Don't let it throw you, buddy. Yes, Alice. Yes, isn't it great? Alice, I'm so excited. I'll tell you what you do. You go on down to the museum... and I'll meet you there right away. Goodbye. Hello. Oh, it's you. I can't hear very well. Come closer to the telephone. I said, ""Good morning, David."" Do you want a leopard? Why should I want a leopard? For that matter, why should I? But I've got one. - Where would you get a leopard? - I wouldn't get a leopard. My brother Mark got him. He's hunting in Brazil and he caught him. Of course. It's a stuffed leopard. Of course. Why should my brother be hunting stuffed leopards in Brazil... when he can find them right here in New York? David, it's lucky I met you yesterday, because you're the only zoologist I know. Of course I know what a zoologist is. Get out of here. No, not you, David. Baby, get back into that bathroom. You're making a nuisance of yourself. No, not you, David. No, I want you to come right over. David, don't be irrelevant. The point is, I have a leopard. The question is, what am I going to do with it? Susan, I regret to say the leopard is your problem. You mean you refuse to help me? David, you can't do that. You can't leave me alone with a leopard. I'll come and get you in my... Susan! What happened? Is it the leopard? No. Nothing happened to me, David, I just... I mean, the leopard! David, the leopard! Can you hear me, Susan? Susan, be brave! I'll be right there! Hold on there, Susan! Susan! Can you hear me? I'll be there, Susan! - You're all right. - Yes, I'm all right. - You lied to me! - No. Just a little. Telling me a ridiculous story about a leopard. - I have a leopard. Right in there. - Where is it? - I don't believe you. - But you have to believe me. I've been the victim of your unbridled imagination once more. Chasing all the way... That'll teach you to go around saying things about people. You've got to get out of this apartment. But I can't. I have a lease. You've got to get that thing out of here. Don't worry, he's all right. What are you gonna do? - Call the zoo. - You can't! That's the meanest thing I ever heard. He's a pet, he'd be miserable in a zoo. Listen. From my brother Mark: ""Dear Susan, I'm sending you Baby."" That's Baby. ""Guard him with your life. ""He's three years old, gentle, and he likes dogs."" I don't know whether that means he eats dogs or is fond of them. Mark's so vague. ""He also likes that song, I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby. "" - That's absurd! - No, it isn't, really. Listen. This is probably the silliest thing that ever happened to me. It's silly but true. He absolutely adores the tune. What's the difference? It's silly that he likes such an old tune. I imagine that down in Brazil... - Stop this, Susan. - Let me show him to you. Don't go near the door! Dear, dear. Watch, David. He'll go right toward the music. Look at that. Isn't this remarkable? It loves it, David. If we put the Victrola in the bathroom, will it go back in? Yes, but the music sounds better out here. Besides, he likes it. Here it comes. Now go away! Please go away! I'm gonna get out of here. Susan, I don't like leopards. - Just think of him as a house cat. - I don't like cats either. - Stand still. Don't be nervous. - Make him stand still! Don't be silly. You can't make a leopard stand still. Do something. Turn off that Victrola. I don't think it's the music. I think it's you. I think you've found a real friend. Isn't it affectionate, like a baby kitten? I never saw anything take such a liking to anyone. It'd follow you anywhere. We'll have no trouble taking it to Connecticut. My farm in Westlake, Connecticut. I'm not going to Westlake, Connecticut. I will not be involved in any more harebrained schemes. Imagine Aunt Elizabeth coming here and running smack into a leopard. That would be an end to my $1 million. If you had an aunt who was going to give you $1 million and she found a leopard... - in your apartment, what would you do? - I don't know. You have to help me. There are only two things I have to do, finish my brontosaurus and get married. Go on, quitter. It's no good calling me names, because I won't argue with you anymore. I don't want anything to do with a leopard. Go on, Baby, down the stairs. Good morning. - Good morning, Professor. - Good morning. You'd better change your mind about coming to Connecticut. Susan, we settled that question once and for all. But what about my leopard? That's your problem. It's not all my problem. Susan, will you please go away? All right. Since he likes you so much, I've decided to give him to you. I won't take him. You've got him. Don't go away! I've got the leopard! Oh, dear, look at that. No, David, all I was doing was driving along. You were standing on the sidewalk yelling, and looking very silly. You know very well you tricked me into this trip. Look. Eating your car. Look at the road! I have a feeling something horrible is going to happen. Everything's going to be all right. I don't care anymore. Hello. What's the matter, did you get Ionely? Susan, if you know any shortcuts, please take them. We'll be there in no time. I just want to deliver this leopard, take the first train back to town... and forget the last 24 hours ever happened. Now, what's wrong with the last 24 hours? I've had a wonderful time. Susan, I don't know. You look at everything upside down. I've never known anyone quite like you. You've just had a bad day, that's all. That's a masterpiece of understatement. Look, I can't discuss anything with you... with Baby breathing down the back of my neck. Get down. Go on. Now lie down. Susan, duck! Never hang on to a leopard's tail! Sing, David! Anyway, I still insist that he was right in the middle of the road. I've never hit anything that was in the right place. That wagon was on the side of the road. It was straight ahead of me. That's why I hit it. - What time is it? - We'll be there in no time. We just have to stop at Westlake and get some meat for Baby. Why, he's already had an assortment of ducks and chickens. Not to mention a couple of swans. All feathers. Yeah, very expensive feathers. I don't see how any pair of swans could cost $150. That was a gyp. If you'd run, as I told you to, we shouldn't have had to pay for them. Susan, when a man is wrestling a leopard in the middle of a pond... he's in no position to run. There it is, David. Please hurry up. Why, of all places, when you have a leopard in the car... did you stop in a town where there's a circus? I didn't stop because there's a circus, but Baby's going to be hungry. Please hurry. If Baby wakes up, we'll be in trouble. I don't suppose it will make any difference, but you're parked in front of a fireplug. I know it. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. You go ahead. 50?, $1.00. Thank you. Yes. What can I do for you? I want 30 pounds of sirloin steak, please. Did you say 30 pounds? - Yes, that's right, 30 pounds. - How will you have it cut? - Just in one piece. - You going to roast it or broil it? - It's going to be eaten raw. - Yeah. Hey, lady. That's a fireplug. I know it. - It's against the law to park alongside one. - I know it. - Come here. - Who, me? Why? I am Constable Slocum. Is that so? - How do you do? I'm Susan Vance. - How do you do? I don't care who you are, I just want you to know you can't park beside a fireplug. - I was just watching the parade. - You were? I suppose you get free seats to the circus. Elmer and I usually get a... That has nothing to do with it. I'm just going to give you a ticket. Thank you very much. I'd love to go to the circus... but you better keep your tickets because I'm busy tonight. Yeah? Well, it ain't that kind of a ticket. Jeepers. Young lady, it might interest you to know that you're under arrest. Oh, well. I mean, why? For parking alongside of a fireplug. I'm not parked next to a fireplug. Yeah? What do you call that? You mean that you think that this is my car? Ain't it? No. That's my car. Why didn't you say so in the first place? You didn't ask me. Say, do you grind this up before you eat it? This isn't for me. It's for Baby. For who? Hurry up, Baby. Get in! - But... - Jump on! That isn't your car! No, but it's my leopard! - Wait a minute! That's my car! - What are you yelling about? They stole my car. Last night, she tried to steal my wife's purse. Don't stand there. Do something! Catch them! Well, Elmer, bless me. Bring back that car! - I'm glad we finally got here - Isn't it wonderful? We could put him in that box Wait, don't open the door - until you close those - I think that is a good idea, too I hope he won't get out Stand by that door, and I'll open this one He'll just walk along, I hope Come on, Baby. Go on In the stall, Baby Come on, baby, right in there, right in there Right in there Now everything is quite all right No, everything is not all Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe for you, but I've got to get to New York. Now one thing's settled, you start worrying about something else. One of us should worry! On top of all this, we've stolen a car! That's all right. I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway. I suppose you'd like me to leave it with the constable on my way back. No, you might be arrested. Besides, it's a hot car. You're going to file the numbers off the engine. No, I'll have the gardener take it back after it's dark. - Stop it! - You're shedding. Now, where's the telephone? - Out that door. - That's all I want to know. What I want to suggest is... I don't want any more suggestions from you. My fianc?e is waiting for me. In order to get married, I have to get to New York. I want you to be married, I think you should be married. I think every man should be. But I don't think any girl will marry you... - Iooking the way you do. - Where's the phone? - In there, but look at yourself. - What's the matter with me? I am dirty, aren't I? You see? What I want to suggest is... The only way I'll follow another of your suggestions... is if you hold a bright object in front of my eyes and twirl it. I understand. I simply wanted to suggest... I don't want any suggestions. I just want to clean up. Where is there a shower? That's what I was going to suggest, a shower. - Hannah. - Yes, Miss Susan? Send these into town and have them cleaned and pressed. - Why? I can do them here. - Don't argue with me, Hannah. Into town. Have them cleaned and pressed. It'll take a lot longer. There's no hurry, no hurry at all. - Hurry up, David. - I am hurrying. - David. - What? - What's in the box? - What did you say? That's the intercostal clavicle of a brontosaurus. Really? It's just an old bone. Yes, it's just an old bone. Put it down gently and go away. All right. Is there anything else I can do for you? Hand me my clothes, will you? They aren't here. They're being pressed. - What? - The gardener's taken them into town. For what? Stop him. I can't wait. I must leave immediately. You can't leave without clothes. I know that. Where are you going? I'm going to take a shower. Susan! Don't leave me here like this! Don't be impatient, David. We'll talk it over after I've finished. Everything's going to be all right. ""Everything's going to be all right."" Certainly, everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to be... I'm losing my mind, that's all. Roaming around Connecticut without any clothes on. I don't believe it. How can all these things happen to just one person? Susan, where are you? Will you come out and help me find some clothes or must I come in and get you? You wouldn't. Yes, I would! Maybe I wouldn't. - Susan, where's the gardener's room? - Why? - Because he must have some clothes. - What? I can't hear you. - You can hear what you want to hear! - What did you say? I just said... Never mind. I'll find the place myself. The gardener must have clothes. Clothes are clothes. The gardener's in town. He couldn't have taken all his clothes with him! Yes, he could. Of all the conceited, spoiled little scatterbrains. My goodness, the man who gets... The man who gets you is gonna have a lifetime of misery! ""Everything's going to be all right."" What do you want? Who are you? - Who are you? - What do you want? Who are you? I don't know. I'm not quite myself today. You look perfectly idiotic in those clothes. These aren't my clothes. Where are your clothes? I've lost my clothes. But why are you wearing these clothes? Because I just went gay all of a sudden! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Now, young man. Stop this nonsense. What are you doing? I'm sitting in the middle of 42nd Street waiting for a bus. Go away! - Who is this man? - I don't know. - Stop it, George! What's he doing here? - I don't know. Susan, come back here. Stop it, George! Aunt Elizabeth, it's you! I've never been so thrilled in my life. This is amazing to see you here, and George dear. - What made you come out here? - Quiet, George! Now, stop gushing and tell me, who is this man? - Where'd you get him? - He's a friend of Mark's. - What's he doing here? - Susan brought me. I don't doubt it, but why? I got a letter from Mark. He said David was an old friend of his. He'd been working very hard in town... and was on the point of having a nervous breakdown. I'm a nut from Brazil. He's very excitable. We let him do whatever he wants. - Where are his clothes? - Susan took them. - What's he doing in that thing? - Mark said he should be allowed... to wear a negligee. No telling what'll happen if he's not allowed to. Does he want to wear those clothes? No, I don't want to wear this thing. I just want to get married! Susan, I forbid it! I absolutely put my foot down. The idea! - Quiet! - Please listen to me! - Quiet! - Don't talk so much. Perhaps you could help me. Perhaps you could help me find some clothes. Why, yes. There must be some of Mark's things around somewhere. - Aren't there some... - Are there? Well... Yes. There are some in Mr. Mark's room, sir. - Yes, sir. - Which is Mr. Mark's room? It's the end, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. Go away. He loves me. He loves me not. David! Where'd he go? He went to get some clothes. If he gets clothes, he'll go away. He's the only man I've ever loved. David! What will I do without David? Stop. Get away from me. George, please be quiet. - David? - What? - Can I come in? - I don't care what you do! - Thanks. Where are you? - Here I am. What do you want? Go on and laugh. I know it looks ridiculous, but I'm past caring. What are you going to do? What I've been trying to do, get back to New York! You can't go dressed that way. They're all I could find, and clothes are clothes. I'm going. I'm going back to New York... if only to repair the damage that's been done since I've known you. The damage to Miss Swallow, the museum, Mr. Peabody and everybody... Mr. Peabody? But, David... the one way to get to Mr. Peabody is through Aunt Elizabeth. Please listen for one second. He'll do anything she tells him to. He'll even like you. He's Aunt Elizabeth's lawyer. He's her lawyer. Mr. Peabody. - What's your aunt's name? - Elizabeth. - But she has another name. - Of course. Never mind. Don't tell me. Why not? It's Random. Mrs. Carleton Random. - Yes, I know. I knew that was coming. - What's the matter? Out of seven million people, why did I have to run into you yesterday? What have I done? Susan, Mrs. Random is going to give away $1 million. I know. I wanted it for the museum. I'm afraid you've made a rather unfavorable impression on Aunt Elizabeth. I quite realize that. - Susan, listen to me. - What? A lot of things have happened but we'll forget them because this is serious. What, David? Can you concentrate for just a moment? There's only one thing to be done. And this is important to me and to my work. What? You're so good-Iooking without your glasses. - Listen to me. Try and remember. - What? I've made a horrible mess of things. Your aunt must never find out who I am. You do understand, don't you? Yes, David. You can tell her that I'm Mark's friend and I have bats in the belfry... but don't ever tell her my name. Can you remember that? - Yes, David. - You're sure? Yes, David. But you are good-Iooking without your glasses. Never mind, Susan. What did I say? What did I do? What did I say? - What did I do? - I just asked you to remember... - I swear I'll remember... - Where is it? - I know exactly what you told me to say. - Where is it? Where's what? - My intercostal clavicle. - Your what? My bone. It's rare. It's precious. What did you do with it? Your bone? - You had it. Give it to me. - I haven't got it. - Did you carry it somewhere? - Why would I carry a bone around? I wouldn't dare give a reason for anything you do. I guess you'll have to find another one. It took three expeditions and five years to find that one! Now that they know where to find one, couldn't you send them back for another? Susan, you had it. You took it out of the box. - Where did you put it? - I put it back in the box. - Was there somebody else in the room? - There was nobody else, but... - George. - Who's George? The dog. Don't you see? Dog, bone. - George! - George! Stop it! You sound like an echo. - George! - Nice George. Did you see him? - See who? - George. Are those the only clothes you could find? Come back here this minute. What are you doing? - Hunting for George. - Why? David wants him. David thinks he's such a nice dog. George? He's a fiend, and you know it. - But David doesn't. - Come here! He's definitely not in the house. That's settled. Don't do that. He knows you want him. He'll hide. Susan, where's he apt to go? - George is apt to go anywhere. - No. Where does he hide things? - How can I tell? - You ought to know. There he is! George! My goodness, look at his nose. He's been digging. He's buried it. There are 26 acres in this garden. That's awful. George, where did you hide that bone? No, David, not that way. Now, George, we're not angry. David and Susan need that bone. It's a nasty old bone, it's hundreds of years old. That's David's bone. Susan will get you a nice, fresh bone if you'll show us where it is. - Look at the nasty little cur! - You'll ruin everything. Spell it. George, don't be stubborn. Susan loves you. Where'd you put it? Don't you remember? Where'd you dig? He's not paying attention... George! It's easy if you know how to handle him. Everything's going to be all right. This must be the spot. He's going to start digging in a minute. That's right, George. - It's very simple if you keep your head. - I do hope he doesn't hurt that bone. Isn't he a strong little man, David? He's got something! Come on, dig. - Dig. - I'm digging. I feel something! I hope it isn't hurt. Look, David, a boot. - A boot. - Don't hit George, David. I wasn't going to hit George. George, that was fine, but you've got to concentrate again. David has to find his bone. No. Not in there. - Isn't this fun? Just like a game. - Yes. George, if you get tired of digging you just tell David and Susan... where you hid it, and they'll dig. Susan, do you think George is really trying? Almost every place he's taken us, we've found something. - There's nothing here. - Look, David, another boot. Another boot. That makes three pairs. Come on, George, quit stalling. Where is it? Don't be discouraged. George, concentrate. Bones, not boots. - There he goes. - See? He's got the idea. - I'm getting tired of all this digging. - Yes, what we need is a plow. - Susan? - Jeepers, it's Aunt Elizabeth. Follow him, David, don't let him get away! Yes, Aunty, I'm coming. Susan, what on earth are you doing? What are all these? Those? They're holes. I can see they're holes. How did they get here? David and George and I were digging. - Who is this David? - He's a friend of Mark's. - Is that all you know about him? - I know I'm going to marry him. He doesn't know it, but I am. If you're planning to marry him on my money, you're mistaken. I don't want another lunatic in my family, I've got enough. When are you going to marry him? What's his name? It's Bone. - Bones? - One Bone. One bone or two, it's a ridiculous name. What does he do? He hunts. Hunts? Hunts what? Well, animals, I should think. - Big-game hunting? - Yes. Very big. You call that big-game hunting? Look at that. Aunty, he's just playing with George. He won't play with George another minute. Tell him dinner's at 8:30 sharp. George, come here this minute! Come along, George. Yes, Alice, I am in Connecticut, but I can't get in... because I've been unavoidably detained. David, listen. I can't hear you. I'm talking. Go away. I'll be with you as soon as I'm finished. Now, David, you have to listen to me. Yes, I know that... Susan, will you please get off the phone? David, it's about the leopard. He's making the most terrific rumpus. - He's hungry. We've got to feed him. - I can't help that. What, Alice, dear? No, it's somebody on the line. - Keep quiet, Susan. - You've got to help. This can't wait. If the people in this house hear him... they'll think something terrible has happened. Susan, get off the line, please... Hello, Alice. What? I don't know what time it is! When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:37 and one quarter. Susan, please! Alice, I can't hear you. When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:40. When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:40 and one half. When you hear the tone, the time will be 7:41. Pardon me. The time is 8:10. When you hear the tone, the time will be... No. My watch shows 8:10 and a quarter. Who are you? Who am I? I'm 8:10... I'm Major Horace Applegate. - What do you want? - Mrs. Random invited me for dinner. Would you please find out if she still wants me? She's hung up. So am I. Why, Horace, what are you doing? Are you coming in or going out? He's coming in to dinner. - How do you do? I'm Susan Vance. - How do you do, Miss Susan? - Hello, Elizabeth. - You're much too big to swing on gates. - I found that out. - Susan, where are you going? I'm just going out. You should be watching George, not playing with telephones... Excuse me. George is fast asleep in my room. Now come here, young man, and don't be afraid. - You look much better in those clothes. - Thank you. - I want you to meet Mr. Bone. - How do you do, Mr. Bone? No. You're Mr. Bone. This is Major Applegate. Yes, I'm Major Applegate. At least, I'm pretty sure I am. That is, I was this morning. There must be some mistake. No mistake. I've known Major Applegate for 20 years. Haven't I, Horace? Twenty-two, to be exact, I think, Elizabeth. It was long about... - How do you do, Mr. Applegate? - How do you do again. Thank you. - Now, Mr. Bone, we'll go for a walk. - I'd like to explain... - You don't need to. - That's all right. I understand. Goodbye, Major Applegate... Mr. Bone. Strange young man, isn't he? Is he suffering from something? He's had a nervous breakdown. - Had or has? - Had. It's left him sort of... You know. My, my, what a pity. And so young, too. The trouble is, Susan seems to be showing the same tendencies. Is that so? You're all right, though? - I hope so. Have a drink. - Thank you. Conversation at dinner may be a trifle difficult... on account of this young man, so I want you to draw him out. I don't know what you mean. Talk about something he understands. Big-game hunting, for instance. - He's a hunter like yourself. - You don't say. Then, Elizabeth, you've come to the right man. There. He's fed. Now I'm sure he's going to be quiet. Come on, let's go in to dinner. Why are you just sitting there? I'm just trying to figure out how I ever got mixed up in all this. ""Mr. Bone."" Isn't that amazing? You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabeth what your real name was. I didn't tell you to think up a name like Bone. Stay there, George. Come on, quickly! Get out of here! - Shut the door. - What's the matter? Did you ever think what would happen if Baby and George got together? - They'd probably like each other. - And if they didn't? - Baby would eat George. - That's what I mean. There it was, straight before me, crouching as tigers do before the kill. But I was ready for him. I drew a bead, leveled away and caught him right between the eyes. My, it certainly was a thrilling experience... as I'm sure you'll all agree... or do you, Mr. Bone? Have you ever been... Pardon me. So sorry. Have you ever been in Arabia, Mr. Bone? I said, ""Have you ever been in Arabia?"" No. I suppose you've spent most of your time in Africa? - Tibet, perhaps? - No. - Malay Peninsula, perchance? - Excuse me. At least that got a rise out of him. You see, you shouldn't have mentioned the Malay Peninsula. He was horribly clawed there by a tiger. He doesn't like talking about it. I had a gun bearer once who was clawed by a tiger. He... The poor... I was just telling Major Applegate that you were clawed by a tiger... in the Malay Peninsula. I've never been there. You've never... Well, no matter. What type of gun do you use in hunting tigers, Mr. Bone? I personally use a bolt-action Mauser with a very large bore. Excuse me. Susan, imagine giving a dinner party with your husband stalking... like Hamlet's ghost all through the meal. Give me patience. No, this is too much. I can't stand it. We were talking about the jungle while you were away, Mr. Bone. - My soup is gone. - It was cold. Digging trenches. Blaming it on an innocent dog. Nothing but a heap of nonsense. Enough to drive a man crazy. And then they say, ""Keep away from the bottle. Don't drink."" No, not even a wee drop to steady a man's nerves. If one more thing happens, I'll quit. And where Aloysius Gogarty goes, Mrs. Aloysius Gogarty goes, too. A doctor chasing after a dog! Just picture it. A vast, mysterious silence vibrant with life... strange cries in the night. - Good gracious, what was that? - That was a loon, Elizabeth. L-O-O-N, yes. Once you've got the jungle in your blood, I wouldn't be able to keep you out of it. - Susan, did you hear that? - I didn't hear a thing. - You didn't? - Are you quite sure that was a loon? Yes, indeed. I've heard many a loon. And if there ever was a loon, that is a loon. - Isn't it, Mr. Bone? - No. - Well, what do you say it was? - A leopard. Don't be ridiculous. Major Applegate would know a leopard cry if he heard it. Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm an authority on animal cries. Now, you take the rogue elephant, for instance. Excuse me, Major. You're right. It is a loon. Thank you. The leopard's cry is something that, once heard, you can never forget. Yes, I know. You know. Thank you. Of course, it varies at different seasons. - Let me see now, what month is this? - June. June? It would go something like this. I'll just prepare for it. Now, let me see. There we have it. - Pardon me. - It's still a loon. Of course, I haven't practiced the leopard cry in a long time. I'm slightly out of voice. - Try again. - Yes, I shall. Now, I didn't do that. It was probably an echo. It was a long time coming back, wasn't it? - Try again. - I shall. There. That's better. That's peculiar. There aren't any leopards in Connecticut, are there? - Yes. - No. - Why do you say yes? - You see... Pardon me. Excuse me. Susan! Finish your dinner and stop this nonsense. All right, but you'll be sorry. I can't stand it. I've got to get away from it. Instead of sitting decently at the table eating their dinners... they're howling and roaring at one another like a lot of banshees. And then they say, ""Gogarty, you mustn't drink. ""Gogarty, you must keep away from the bottle."" The bottle. As if a man didn't need something to listen to them. I'm within my rights. I'm perfectly within my... If one more thing happens to upset me, I'll be seeing things. Hannah. Hannah Gogarty! Me gun! - Now what's happened? - This is no time for personalities. What would you be wanting of a gun now? Hand me my gun. Be quiet, both of you! Gogarty, what is all this? - I saw it outside. - Saw what? A cat as big as a cow, with eyes like balls of fire. Clean up this mess. And serve the next course. Do you realize what's happened? Baby's escaped! - I don't care. - We've got to catch him. - I've got to watch George. - You're not staying here. If you stay here, I'll tell Aunty that your name is Dr. David Huxley. - Right now. - Don't! All right, I'll go with you. Major Applegate, keep an eye on George! Thank you. Baby! The door's open. - Is he there? - I don't know. Nope, he's gone. Oh, dear. Now Aunt Elizabeth... Don't lose your head. - My what? - Your head. - I've got my head. I've lost my leopard. - Now, wait a minute. Nothing's gained by uncontrolled hysteria. - Compose yourself. - What should we do? I'll call the zoo, say we saw a leopard, and they'll catch him. Come on. Susan, I hope this time you've come to stay. Yes, I've come to stay, Aunty. We've just been walking up and down. Where's that young man going now? He's just going in to take a rest. He has to take frequent rests. The doctor says... Have you ever had jungle fever, Major? You have. Then you realize how important rest is. Poor Mr. Bone. In his case, it's rather difficult... because he has two doctors. One says rest, one says exercise. Which do you prefer? - I think that perhaps... - Why, Susan, listen to this. - What? - This is a cable from Mark. - Mark? - Not a particle of sense in it. What does it say? ""Are you pleased with Baby? Love, Mark."" - Mark? - And not a word about my leopard. Your leopard? - I've always wanted a leopard. - Excuse me. You know, he promised... Thank you very much. Don't call the zoo. - I just called. It's all fixed. - Call back and unfix it. - No questions, call back. - I told them they could have the leopard. You've given away Baby? You have no right! - It's your fault. You've ruined everything! - I've had enough. I quit. You can't quit. Call them back. - But you said... - Everything's changed. - That leopard belongs to Aunt Elizabeth. - Aunt Elizabeth? Just call back and say you were mistaken. I've just managed to convince them that I did see a leopard. - They'll never believe me. - I'll fix that. I'll say you're a drug addict. - You're always seeing things. - Never mind. Give me that phone. - Hello, operator? - Not so loud. Get me Westlake-284. - I don't know... - Never mind, David. Hello. Is that zoo? Nobody's talking baby talk. I'm the man that called up about the leopard. You don't have to do anything. It's all been a mistake. - Stop them! - What's the matter? - What did he say? - It's too late. It was the night watchman. - He said everybody's out leopard hunting. - Jeepers! You've gotten us into a wonderful mess. Let's think before we act. - You think. You think faster than me. - What do you take to catch a leopard? - How big a leopard? - We've got to catch him before they do. - I've got to watch George. - We'll take George with us. Aunty, we're taking George for a walk. - Where's the leash? - My goodness! - Where's George? - Where's George? - Why this morbid interest? - I've got to find him. What for? He knows where my intercostal clavicle is. Your what? Major Appletree, you promised to watch George. - I did. - But you didn't. Where is he? - He's gone. - Gone where? - Out that door. - Why didn't you say so? No, not that door. That door. - Thank you. - That's right. I can't stand this another moment. Come along. Let's get some fresh air. - Yes. Shall we run? - Yes. I can't understand why a loon would answer a leopard's cry. There's something wrong. - They both sound exactly alike to me. - No, pardon me, Elizabeth. Please, the leopard's cry is entirely different. As I explained to you in there, the leopard's cry goes like this. What a terrible noise. I don't see how you do it. It's done largely with the palate. The hands play an important part in the resonance and carrying power. - Why do you put your thumbs together? - You see, the thumbs... it's very necessary that the base of the thumbs are close together like that. That brings out a sort of pear-shaped tone, you see? Having done this, you take a deep breath, keep the throat well open... and out comes... My. That's fine, Elizabeth... for one who hasn't had any practice. Really, it is. You've got something there. - Got what? - The mating cry. - Now, don't be rude, Horace. - I'm not rude. I was merely alluding to the scream you did just now. - I didn't scream. - You didn't scream? - I certainly did not. - You didn't scream? No. I ought to know if I screamed. Then there must be something wrong here. I should say so. I've never known anything like it. Ever since I came into the house there's been something wrong. - Elizabeth... - It's been bedlam! - Don't you think it's time we went inside? - No. We've only just left it. But don't you think it's a good idea to go back? No, I think it's a good idea to continue our walk. But don't you find it a bit chilly without a gun? - Why don't you sing, David? - I can't. - You can. You have a fine strong voice. - But not for singing. It's not fair. You're just being stubborn. - That's a dog. - George. - What's the matter? - Something moved in that bush. Let me go first. Don't you think it would be better if I went first? No. You might get hurt. Thank you, David. - I can't see a thing. - Neither can I. Are you sure you saw something moving in here, because I can't... Susan, where are you? - Here I am. - This is no time to be playing squat tag. I'm not playing. I'm caught on something. Help me, will you? - Help me, will you? - No. That's poison ivy. I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallow this way. I'll bet she knows poison ivy when she sees it. Yes, I bet poison ivy runs when it sees her. I'm not here to discuss Miss Swallow. I'm looking for George. I'll find him if... David, are you all right? - Don't laugh. - I can't help it. You look so silly. Did you hear that? That's Baby. - It's George, too. - You don't suppose... Shut up. Look! Look, David, they like each other. But goodness knows how long that's going to last. In another minute, my intercostal clavicle will be gone forever. Here, George. Come here. No. Susan, be quiet. Is there any way to cross this stream? - Surely it's shallow. We can wade across. - Good. The riverbed's changed. Did we get across? No, we're right back where we started, only we're wet. Now George and Baby have disappeared. While you were at it, you might as well have gone to the other side. While I'm wet I'm gonna go to the other side! Don't leave me! If we'd had a bathhouse, this wouldn't have been so complicated. Next time I'll try and arrange one. Or perhaps there are portable bathhouses for people like you. There must be. Don't be so grouchy. We could have such fun. There's moonlight and everything is so lovely. - And I do so like being with you. - You do? Well, I like peace and quiet. But it's peaceful and quiet here. Let's just stay here and let George and Baby look for us. Your sock's on fire. That's all right. I don't care anymore. - That's fine. Throw the other one in. - That's true. You could have... Don't be upset, David. Well, who wouldn't be? Here I am, trying to help you find a leopard... so that your Aunt Elizabeth won't be angry at you. And then she'll probably give you the $1 million I need for my museum. If you'd planned it, you couldn't have ruined my chances more completely. You told your aunt I was crazy, didn't you? You told her my name was Bone and you didn't tell me. You told her I was a big-game hunter and didn't tell me. You tell anybody anything that comes into your head... and you don't tell me. - Here's something else I didn't tell you. - What now? Mr. Peabody's coming to see Aunt Elizabeth tonight. Oh, dear. That's the end, that's all. Peabody's sure to tell your aunt who I am. He'll never remember those four years' hard work... I put in on that brontosaurus. No. All he'll remember is that I conked him on the head with a rock last night. Where's that music coming from, David? Westlake. There's a circus there. A... Come and see the Harem Nights, boys. Sheena and Neema. They've just escaped from the palace of a sheik. The owner's got a job for you. He wants you to take his leopard to Bridgeport. - What happened? - Just gave his new trainer a going-over. Hurt him bad? Bad? You think three minutes alone with that cat did him any good? Should've shot him last summer, when he ripped up Calhouney. What do we do with him? Deliver him to this address. They've got a gas chamber. - I've phoned over. You go along, too, Mac. - Who, me? - You heard what I said. - Where is Bridgeport? How should I know? Somewhere on the state highway. Ask somebody, and get going. - Well, that's that. Let's get going. - All right. Sure you don't want my coat? - No, I'm completely dry. - Let's go, then. I wonder what that is? Hey, Mac, see what that sign says. - David, it's the zoo truck. - Is it? They've got Baby. Is George with him? I can't see George, but we've got to get Baby away from them. No. All I promised to do was help you find Baby. You found him. All you have to do is go and talk to those men in the front... while I let Baby out the back. Give me the rope. But what'll I say to them? They're from the zoo. Tell them you're a zoologist. Talk about zoos. Go ahead, go on. I can't find Bridgeport. You've got the map upside down. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Hello. May I help you? Yeah. Do you know the way to Bridgeport? I'm not going to Bridgeport. Not you. We're going to Bridgeport. Do you know which way it is? - Yes. - It's that way, ain't it? - Yes. - But I thought it was that way. - Yes, it is. - There, I told you. Don't you worry. I'll soon get you out. Come on. Get this around your neck, that's a good boy. Put your head through. Come on. Hey, what's the big idea? Come on. Put your head through here, and I'll take you back home. Come on, sweetie. ...and New York is straight ahead. This guy ain't got all his buttons. Well, I... You see... - We have a... - David, he's escaped! - I was just explaining to these gentlemen... - He's escaped! Oh, he's escaped. Shall we help you tie him up, lady? No, not me. You're mistaken. Goodnight, gentlemen. Over there. We're on the right track now, I'm sure. Do you see him? - I think he's further down this way. - I'll try here. I'm absolutely certain the sound's coming from this way. - What's that? - Somebody's shooting at him. - You missed it again. - Quiet! Major Applegate, don't shoot. Stand back, please. I won't miss this time. You don't understand. We're trying to catch it. - You are? Well, so am I. - It's a tame leopard. I don't like to say so at this moment, but everybody knows you're crazy. - Please don't do that. - Miss Susan, please! Why don't you explain to him? Perhaps he'll catch your leopard. You know that Aunt Elizabeth was expecting a leopard from Brazil, don't you? - I had heard that. - Well, that's her leopard, and it's tame. Impossible. There can be no such thing as a tame... A tame leopard? We had it locked up and it escaped. - Are you sure it's quite harmless? - Absolutely. My goodness, why didn't you say so in the first place? I apologize to you, Mr. Boney, I really do. Even though it is tame, I think we should try to catch it. Which way did it go? That way. We'll go that way, you go that way. Come on, David. Don't shoot. No, of course not. I knew all the time he was tame. - Is that so? - Yes, I patted him on the back. Stretched me hand right out, patted him on the back. - He's as gentle as a kitty. - Gentle as a kitty? I don't know why you didn't mention all this... There he is. This will all be quite simple. Let me have that rope, will you? Now, you hold the gun. We shan't need that any further. Gogarty, you stand perfectly still and leave everything to me. I've had vast experience in these matters. Here, kitty. Come, kitty. Don't you fool me. You're not afraid of me, now, are you? Come, puss. You say you patted this beast? In a manner of speaking, I did. Personally, Gogarty, I think you're a liar. Get out of me way! Use the gun! - You see him, David? - No. I seem to have lost my sense of direction. I wonder where we are. My guess is, somewhere near the Canadian border by now. My glasses! Don't move, Susan. Here they are. They're broken. I'm so sorry. It doesn't make any difference. The things I've been doing today, I can do just as well with my eyes shut. Anyway, David, you look much handsomer without them. Stop it. Look, David, I've lost my heel! Look at me walk. - Born on the side of a hill. - Stop. - I was born on the side of a hill. - Stop. Look, Susan, we're not getting anywhere like this. You must be very tired, and I suggest you go home. But, David, we can't quit now. We've let a wild animal loose on an innocent countryside. We can't just go home and sleep. It wouldn't be right. You misunderstand me. I want you to go home. - You mean you want me to go home? - Yes. You mean you don't want me to help you anymore? - No. - After all the fun we've had? - Yes. - And after all the things I've done for you? That's what I mean. All right, I know enough to go when I'm not wanted. And don't you worry about me, I can take care of myself. Oh, my goodness. Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself? No, I didn't hurt myself. It's not that. It's just that I'm miserable because you don't like me anymore. Yes, I do. You tried to get rid of me and you don't think of me. You don't like me anymore. Your face is dirty. Now you're being nice to me... after all the horrible things I've done to you. Stop crying, Susan, please. It's just that everything I do with the best intentions... seems to turn out badly. Yes, it does, doesn't it? Please let me come with you. All right, Susan. You can come with me. - Are you sure you want me? - Yes. - Positive? - Yes, you can come. Come on. Well, don't you worry, David. Because if there's anything that I can do to help you... just let me know, and I'll do it. Don't do it until I let you know. Come on, George. Look, David. Baby's on the roof. Come on, Baby. Come on down. Make him get down. I suppose you'd like me to climb up and push him down. Maybe we'd better sing. Sing, David. - Where are you going? - I'll be back! Not you, it. - What are you doing, may I ask? - Singing. If you're paying a bet, there must be somewhere else to pay it. I'm not paying a bet, there's a leopard on your roof. I'm not going to bandy words with you at this time of night. There is a leopard on your roof, and it's mine. I have to get it, and to get it, I have to sing. There's nothing on my roof. Come on, you fool. There's nothing on your roof? - No! - All right. There's nothing on your roof. Poor girl. You'd better go down, Fritz. - Sing if you like, dear. - Thank you. You can sing, too. Baby, don't! Why did you have to do that? You frightened him away. - Quiet, it's all right. - It's not all right. - Don't worry. - I have to worry. I've lost my leopard. - Please help me find him. - I will. Come with me. - But he went that way. - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did. I saw him. - You're wrong. He's up there. - Where? - Peeking around the corner. See it? There's nothing there! Yes, there is. You just come along into the house. Let me go! I don't want to go with you. You don't seem to understand that there's $1 million at stake. $1 million? Well, you will get it. We have it right in there, all in $1 bills. Now you come along. No! Don't do this to me! This is awful! Elmer, look. - You know him? - No. Looks like a peeping Tom. Get your gun out. We'll nab him. Stick them up. Grab him, Elmer. I have to get my dog. Don't go away, George! Don't argue. Inside. - What are you doing? - I have a hairpin. I did it once with a trunk. Anyway, when they find out who we are, they'll let us out. When they find out who you are, they'll pad the cell. We've picked up a girl who says she's your niece. Now, the question is, have you or have you not got a niece? Of course I have a niece, but she's not singing around under windows. She's decently in bed. I wouldn't be too sure, Elizabeth. Horace, do be quiet. I'll talk to you presently. Now, lady, do you definitely refuse to come and identify this girl? If you continue to annoy me about this girl... who is no responsibility of mine, I'll have you arrested. - The idea. - Hello. She says her niece is in bed. Just what I expected. That girl is lying. - I think they're both lying. - What are you going to do about it? - What would you do? - Find out the truth. You're right. I'll have a little talk with them. Come on, Elmer. Open her up. You two, get your ears up 'cause I've got something to tell you. - If you wanna get out, better listen. - I'm listening. Quiet. I'll get to you later. I want you to tell me the whole truth. - What did my aunt say? - Be quiet, please. What did my aunt say? Your aunt said... Young lady, you haven't got an aunt. - I certainly have got an aunt. - Quiet, please. Look here, young fellow, I want you to tell me... just exactly what were you doing tonight? - We were hunting for a leopard. - You were hunting for a leopard? Now look here, young lady, you know that's silly. - There never was a leopard in Connecticut. - There is now. Now, listen here. I'm going to stay here if it takes all year. I am waiting for you to tell the truth. If you wait for her to tell the truth, you'll have a long gray beard. You know, my grandfather had... Quiet! Young man, I don't want any more slick remarks out of you. This is a jail. Have a little respect for the law. I'm just trying to explain. It all started over at my aunt... Her aunt's house. Her aunt's house? - Her aunt promised to give me a lot of... - Hold on there, bub. Just a minute. She hasn't got an aunt. I do. She's my father's sister. Look here, Constable, stop wasting your time. Now, quiet. You want us to get out of here, don't you? Lady, yes, I certainly do. I gave you my aunt's telephone number, didn't I? And you called her up, didn't you? What did she say? - She said that you were home in bed. - Then what am I doing here? You're here because your aunt... Confound it, lady, you know that you haven't got an aunt. - If I did have an aunt... - She'd muzzle you. You can't talk to me that way. I don't like to see young people in jail. I have children of my own. I don't care about your family. All I want to do is get out of here. I don't have time to waste sitting around in jail. - Go away, please. - Shut up, David. - David, please be quiet. - Let me tell you what happened. You're not going to get anywhere with her. Just come with me. If one of us talks at a time, now we're really getting somewhere. Now then, speak up, speak fast. - I'll explain the whole thing... - Elmer! Get the key here, quick. Lock him up. A fine officer you are. Locking up a dangerous criminal without locking him up. - Look, it's not locked. - Thank you. I've seen it! I've seen a cheetah in the park. You have no right to do that! What's going on here? - Here's something for you, Constable. - What's the charge? We caught him in front of the meat market in Dr. Lehman's stolen car. So you're a car thief? No man is going to call Aloysius Gogarty a car thief. Come on! Lock him up. Hey, let go! Here you are, fellow. This should hold you for a while. Hello, Gogarty. Hello, Miss Susan. How did you get here? Influence. Don't worry, Gogarty. I'll get you out. Sure. Look, she got me out. Hold on here. Do you know this young lady? Of course. Don't I work for her aunt? - You what? - Don't I work for her aunt? If one more person mentions that she's got an aunt... I'll put you all on bread and water for 30 days. Well, where is everyone? Who's in charge here? Right in there. Hey, Constable! What do you mean by locking up my niece? I won't stand for it! Give me the keys. Madam, you're hysterical. - What is it you want? - She wants her niece. I certainly do. I want my niece right here. - Who is your niece? - Give us a description of her. - She's about so tall... - Aunt Elizabeth, is that you? There she is now. Hold on just a minute. Lady, tell me, who are you? I am Mrs. Carleton Random, and I want my niece. - You're Mrs. Carleton Random? - I certainly am. - And you say your niece is here? - She certainly is. That's where I got you. The young lady here ain't got no aunt. And you're not Mrs. Carleton Random, because I talked to her... on the phone not 10 minutes ago. I ought to know who I am! Yes, you should, I think. You did talk to her 10 minutes ago... on the phone. - How do you know? - I was there. - Who are you? - I'm the niece... I'm the aunt... I'm Major Horace Applegate of the Explorer's Club. What are you doing with that gun? I have been hunting a leopard. - You've been hunting leopards? - I said so, yes. - Any luck? - Not what I'm accustomed to, no. I have been a bit confused regarding the leopards here. - Boys. - You have something on your mind. Not so fast, lady. We just want to find out. This old battle-ax keeps yelling that she's Mrs. Random. Why, that's ridiculous. Mrs. Random is in bed. And don't you be calling up here again. Good night. Good night. Well, just as you said, doc, they're all lying. Obviously. I have no doubt you'll find you made a very important haul. Yeah, thanks to you, doc. If you get their confessions, there'll be a lot of things you will turn up. Yeah? Well, I'll try it again. Come on, boys. Quiet! I'm warning you. The first one who lets a squeak out... I'll put in solitary confinement. I'm gonna ask this man some questions. I want absolute quiet. You said your name's Bone. You stick to it? Won't do any good, we don't believe you. We know that's an alias. - They're all impersonators. - Why'd you try to break into his house? I was after a leopard. Leopard. Doc, they still stick to it. All agreed on one story. How about that bank robbery in Oldtown? What about it? How much did they get? They got a pretty penny. Must've got $5,600... Say, who's asking the questions, you or me? Who was with you last month in that mail-truck job? Mickey the Mouse and Donald the Duck. Doc, make a note of their names. Now we're getting someplace. You've gotta speak up. Quiet, lady. I'm waiting for you. Quiet, lady. Speak up now. Hey, flatfoot! You ain't getting no place. Come here. - Me? - Yes, you. Come on, haul it over. You want someone to talk, don't you? It's about time. I certainly do. Get me out and I'll unbutton my puss and shoot the works. Say, hold on, lady. I thought that you were... - You ain't no lady! - I kind of had you fooled, didn't I? Always wanted to make a sucker out of a copper. What did I tell you my name was? - Your name is... Doc, what's her name? - Susan Vance. Vaunce, kiddie. That's my society moniker. But the mob all calls me ""Swinging Door"" Susie. Now you peg me? Come on, toots, open up. - Open up, I'll make you feel hot. - Stop that. I'm not opening any doors here until you promise to talk. I talk, I'll talk so much, it'll make your hair curl. Hear that, doc? She's promised to talk. All right, open it up. Susan, whatever it is, it won't work. ""Swinging Door"" Susie hasn't flopped yet. I'm out this far, ain't I? Well, so long, gang. I'm not taking the rap for this job. It's every man for himself. Quiet! I meant what I told you. You, too. Quit beefing. Get wise to your pal. The heat's on, Jerry. Ain't his name Bone? You mean to say you don't remember Jerry the Nipper? Make a note of that, doc. She's making all this up out of motion pictures. I thought I saw you with that red-headed skirt in a motion picture. There, doc, another woman. Sure. I wouldn't be squealing if he hadn't been with another twist. So he's a lady-killer? A lady-killer? Why, he's a regular Don Swan. Loves the ladies, don't you, honey? He bops them over. 1, 2, 3, boom! Just like that. - He's a wolf. - Now I'm a wolf! I'll send you a box of birdseed. Susie, I want you to tell the truth. You'll never get into trouble. You're limping. I suppose you got shot in a stickup? - No, I lost my heel. - Don't bother about him. Sit down there. Doc, grab this chair. Elmer, grab a hold of that typewriter. I wanna get this whole thing down in affidavit form. - Young lady, I want you to talk... - Cigarette me, then I'll talk. - I don't smoke cigarettes. - This will have to do. - That? - It's a twofer. - What's that? - Two for a nickel. Give me a match. I'm not going to stand for that in this jail. No smoking, no talking. Put me back in the cell. Ain't gonna talk unless I have a cigarette. Hold it. Sit down. Doc, give her one of them cigarettes. If you'll just tell the truth, we'll make it as easy as we can... My case, if you please. There I go again. Sorry. Force of habit. Forgot where I was for a minute. How about a little fresh air? It's kind of hot in here. It is a little bit muggy. It's always that way around here, this time of year. It's the humidity. What about the Cleghorn jewels? That's hot ice. We're waiting for it to cool off. We're waiting... What do you mean, ""we""? The gang. All of us. You all belong to the same gang? Sure. The Leopard Gang. That's what I'm after. We'll round them all up with one fell swoop. Got that, doc? Fine. How about you, Elmer? Not so fast. This is new to me. Hold on. You can't spell ""leopard"" with a ""U."" - How do you spell it? - Double ""U."" - What about that bank robbery? - Boy, wasn't that a honey? A neater job has never been pulled in this neck of the woods. Jerry was the inside man on that job. He was, was he? Were you there, too? Sure, what do you think? I'm a one-man woman. Where my man goes, I go. ""Babyface"" Horace, he's the pick-up man... Wait! You're talking too fast! What's that? Confound it, doc! You only got as far as the Cleghorn jewels. We gotta start all over again. Now, young lady... - There she goes. - She's got my car again! Go on, boys, after her. Hurry up and get her. There she goes. Go get her, boys! If you don't, there'll be a shakeup in this department. - Are you the constable? - Yes. I'm looking for... Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard. I'll lock you up. I'm looking for Mrs. Carleton Random. So is everybody else. Let me tell you, she's not here. - I have reason to believe she is here. - Who're you? Her attorney, Alexander Peabody. I'm Miss Swallow. I'm looking for a man by the name of Dr. David Huxley. Is he here with Mrs. Random? Lady, the only folks here is a woman who keeps saying she's Mrs. Random. Then we got a gangster named Bone. Then we have ""Babyface"" Horace. Stop it. Then... What is it you want? I can identify this gentleman. You may remember me. I testified during the breaking of the Borden will. Yes, I remember. I demand to see my client at once. Slocum, you may have made a mistake. And if you have made a mistake... your position as constable in this county will be in serious jeopardy. - Are you sure he's the old lady's attorney? - Positively. Election next week, too. Mr. Peabody, just step right inside, and we'll straighten this thing out. As a matter of fact, we don't make mistakes. Here you are. Is she or ain't she Mrs. Random? It's just about time you came. Of course she's Mrs. Random. This is absurd. Open that door. - I told you. - All right. What about him? - David, I don't understand... - Alice, it's just one of those things. I can't explain it. It happened, and here I am. Yes, in the last place I expected to find you. I don't like it any better than you do. And let that young man out, too. Shucks, looks like I got the whole thing fuddled up. I'm sorry, that's all I can say. You haven't heard the end of this, either. I... Huxley! Why did you throw rocks at me last night? This is the young man to whom you wanted me to donate $1 million... for his museum? Yes. No, I didn't. I changed my mind. David, what have you done? Just name anything, and I've done it. Joe, what are we gonna tell them? Tell them the truth. We lost the leopard. You the constable around here? Until the next election, anyway. What is it you want? - We need some help. - That's what I'm here for. What is it? We're looking for... Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard. How did you know that? - Know what? - That we're looking for a leopard. This has gone far enough. There are no leopards in the state of... - Get down, everybody! - That's a bad cat. Somebody get a gun. Hold on, don't be alarmed. There's no need to be frightened. Everything's going to be all right. Hello, Baby. - Is this my leopard? - Yes. That's Baby. He didn't act that way with me. Wait a minute. That ain't my leopard. Of course it isn't. That's why I took it out of the truck. You never let that one out of the truck. You couldn't touch our cat with a 10-foot pole. You mean there's another leopard? That's what I'm telling you. Our cat came from the circus. He just clawed a man. He's bad. My goodness! Susan's out trying to catch the wrong leopard. Poor darling Susan. She's in danger, and she's helpless without me. What's the matter with you? Come on. If you don't want to walk, I'll drag you. You've got to get me out of this, Baby. What's the matter? You've been slapping at me the whole way. We've got to get in here. You might as well come without being stubborn... because I'm going to drag you in. I'm just as determined as you are, so you might just as well come with me. I'm going to drag you in here. I don't like jail any more than you do, but this is where we've got to be. Did I fool you this time! You thought I was doing the wrong thing, but I've got him. No, you haven't, Susan. Look! Boys! Don't leave me in here! David, help me! Run! Run while you have the chance! - I won't leave you. I love you. - What? Poke him, David. Let go, Susan, please. Please, go back. Can't you see I'm trying to get it into the cell? Get in there! Get the keys, Susan! Give it to me. You're wonderful. You're absolutely wonderful. You're a hero. You saved my life. You'll go down in history. I've never seen such bravery... Did you want to say something? What was it? David, you've fainted. There's nothing else I can say, except that I'm glad... that before our marriage you showed yourself up in your true colors. You're just a butterfly. Now I'm a butterfly. Where are you going, David? Don't go up there. I want to talk to you. See? I've got it. I can't even see you. Now where are you? There you are. I followed George around for three days and dug holes with him. And then he came and put it in my shoe. Darling, look! David, don't be mad at me. Thank you very much. Put it down on the table and go away. I don't want to go away. I want to talk to you. Write me a letter. Don't! Go back, Susan! Jeepers, it's high up here. Please go back down the ladder quietly. When I go down, I'll go down quietly, David... but I want to find out something first. Why did you run up that ladder when I came in here? If you must know, I'm afraid of you. If you're afraid of me, that's the same as if... Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right. Every time you say that, something happens. Please go down because you've already cost the museum $1 million. I haven't. I've got the $1 million. Aunt Elizabeth gave it to me... and I'm going to give it to you for the museum. I'm sure they'll be very pleased. Aren't you pleased, David? - Yes, I suppose so, but... - It's too late, isn't it? I've made a mess of everything, haven't I? I was so happy when I found the bone this morning. If I could only make you understand. All that happened, happened because I was trying to keep you near me. I just did anything that came into my head. I'm so sorry. I ought to thank you. - Thank me? - Yes. For what? I've just discovered that was the best day I ever had in my whole life. - You don't mean it? - I've never had a better time. - But I was there. - That's what made it so good. - Did you really have a good time? - Yes, I did! That's wonderful. Do you realize what that means? That means that you must like me a little bit. - It's more than that. - Is it? Yes. I love you, I think. That's wonderful because I love you, too. Stop rocking, David. I'm not rocking. I... Please, the brontosaurus! Four years' work went into this. - Look out, Susan, something's going to... - I'm falling! Hold on, Susan! Hold on! Don't let go! David, look what I've done. I'm so sorry. David, can you ever forgive me? You can, and you still love me. - Susan, that... - You do.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Bringing_Up_Baby-29947
The Dead Zone (1983) - full transcript,"Five years after a traffic accident that left him in a coma, a man awakens to discover that he has the ability to foresee future events and even prevent tragedies from happening. Will these new abilities prove to be a blessing or a curse?","""... and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door. And his eyes have all the seeming of the demons that he's dreaming. The lamplight streaming throws his shadow on the floor.

A teacher gets chased by a headless demon. Hi. Can teachers be expelled for kissing? - They get fired. - Thank God it's Friday. You sound like my students. Why don't you carry my books? I hope you haven't made plans. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - Aaahhh! - Aaahhh! You okay? - What's wrong? - I don't know. It didn't used to bother me. Enjoy the ride, folks? Take it away. Do you want to come in? I'd better not. Are you all right? I'm okay. I had a wonderful time. Are you sure you don't want to come in? You could spend the night here. I'd better not. Some things are worth waiting for. My books. Johnny, wait! I'm so crazy about you. I'm going to marry you. You better. - Drive carefully. - I will. Where's Intensive Care? Johnny. Johnny, don't leave me, please. Johnny, you're going to get better. I know you are. Can you hear me? We're going to get married. Don't leave me. Hello, John. My name's Weizak. I'm Dr. Sam Weizak. I'm the director of this clinic. You've been our guest for a while. Guest? That's a funny way of putting it. How do you feel? My throat hurts. Try a little water. Come. Hey, slow down. Not so fast. Slow down. You've been involved in a terrible traffic accident. Do you remember? Am I okay? Well... you've been smashed up pretty badly. What is it? No bandages. How come? Your parents are here. They're right next door. I'll bring them in now. Is that okay? Sure. Do come in. Hi, Mom, Dad. John. Johnny. Johnny, Johnny. It's a miracle, John. I know. I was lucky. Look. Not a scratch. The Lord has delivered you from your trance. Remember what we discussed, Mrs. Smith. What is she talking about? Shh! You've been in a coma, Johnny. Not a trance. Coma? For how long? We're just glad to have you back. Dad, how long? Five years. Five long years, John. Lost for five years. And now reborn unto me. Five... years? What about Sarah? Cast her from your thoughts. She's turned her back on you. She cleaves now unto another man, a husband. Husband? Ahhh! Aaahhh! - Amy. - Aaahhh! Aaahhh! Amy! - Amy. - Amy is my daughter's name. Your daughter's screaming. The house is burning. Your daughter's in the house. It's not too late. Amy. Amy! Aaahhh! Your daughter is screaming. Amy's screaming. It's not too late. Hurry up! First, we will get your body back into shape. Although you've been exercised regularly, the ligaments have shortened a little. Must I live in a wheelchair? Not permanently. And not for very long. Not if I can help it. I, uh... I won't deceive you, John. Your therapy will be long and painful. But you will walk. Thank you. The wolf is loose. John, are you all right? No match for them. Horses, fire. Mamichka! No! The boy is safe. The boy is safe. John! John! Are you all right? Hmm? Tell me... what about the boy? You keep saying, ""The boy is safe. "" - What boy? - You. You're the boy. I am the boy? - She saved you. She's alive, Sam. - Who? Your mother. - No, that's not possible. - She survived. John, my mother is dead. She's alive. I know her name and where she lives. But that is not possible, John. How could you know that? How... I'm scared, Sam. What's happening to me? - Hello? - Hello. May I speak to... Yes? - Is Johanna there, please? - One moment. Hello? Who is this, please? Hello? Well... you are either in possession of a very new human ability... or a very old one. Yes? Oh. Over here will be fine. Thank you. We're trying to get you back on your feet. This should help you regain your strength. What's on your mind? You were right, John... about my mother. I got the number from information. It was in the phone book. Did you talk to her? No, I didn't. I, um... She came to the phone, but I just couldn't talk to her. I hung up. Why? Why? Because it wasn't meant to be. Chug, chug, chug. Come on. Keep it moving. Weight down, knees up. Keep it moving. - That's it. - That's it? - That's what I get, 8 lousy steps? - I counted 10. I'd like you to do some serious chugging. I'm going to run around the building. - Keep chugging? - Okay. See you. Johnny. They told me you were outside. I am. I didn't know if I should come or not. It's all right. You got your hair cut. Yeah, a long time ago. You lost weight. They call it coma diet... lose weight while you sleep. You know I got married. I heard that. You'd like him. You still teach? Uh-uh. Mothering's a full time job. Kids, too? I didn't know that. I'm sorry. I thought your father would have told you. He's a wonderful little boy. His name's Denny. - How old is he? - Ten months. I'm glad for you. Don't look at me like that. What am I going to do? For you, five years have passed. For me, it's the next day. My feelings haven't changed yet. Oh, Johnny. Why did it have to happen? Bad luck. I never should have let you go that night. It was my idea, remember? What a jerk. Everybody's talking about you. You're the talk of the town. 'Cause I got my head bashed in and I'm alive? Because you have the power of second sight. Is it true, Johnny? The papers won't let up about it. I keep thinking about a line from The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the last thing I gave my class before the accident. Ichabod Crane disappears. The line goes, ""As he was a bachelor and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled their head about him anymore. "" Is that what you're afraid of? That's what I want. That's what I want. I don't approve. The press has been hounding me. I want it over with. Once you've set something like this in motion, it seems you never know where it will lead. It's already in motion. I want to stop it. They put it out, and that's all there is. Clement Dardis, WJGE-TV. What happened to the girl? I understand she's fine. Well, uh... would you call this a psychic experience? - No, I would not. - Ever had one before? No. How about a demonstration, John? - A what? - You know, a demonstration. You got any predictions? You think Greg Stillson is going to unseat Senator Proctor? - Who? - Greg Stillson. Uh... thank you, sir. - No more. - Wait, wait a minute! How about the election? I don't even know who you're talking about. Well, you didn't know anything about this nurse. That was different. Well, I... I touched her hand. Oh. All right. All right! Now, touch my hand. Tell me, is my house on fire, John? - Shall I stop this? - No. You want to know if you're going to die? We'll all die. You want to know if you'll die tomorrow. Is that right? You want to know why your sister killed herself. All right. Go on. - It's not all right. - It's okay. It's not okay. Okay. I won't talk about that! - Let go, you fucking freak! - Please stop it! Leave him alone! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You're hurting him! Dr. Danvers, call 1522. Dr. Danvers, call 1522. Oh, yes, Nurse. She knows you're coming. Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy. Herb? It's Johnny, Mom. Ohh... Johnny. Leave your boots outside the door. Don't go tracking snow all over the house. I won't. You're a good boy. You're wasting your time here, Sheriff. You know that, don't you? Well, you never know, Frank. It's worth a try. - Mr. Smith? - Yeah, I'm Herb Smith. Sheriff Bannerman, Castle Rock. May I come in? Yeah, sure. Come in. It's a little nippy out there. - That's a nice tree. - Thanks. May I do something for you, Sheriff? Actually, I came to see your son. Are you John? Sheriff Bannerman. Castle Rock. I've come to you with what you could call a proposal. It concerns the Castle Rock Killer. - Have you heard of him? - Sure. I don't know whether it's true or not, John... about these psychic powers of yours. If it's true, I could use your help. Maybe you should give him... Think about it, but bear in mind some decent young women from homes just like this have met with terrible, terrible deaths. Now, I'm at my wits' end. I've exhausted about every approach to this situation. I've come up with nothing. I feel you can help me. You made a mistake. I was sorry to hear about your mother's death. I understand she was a good woman, Christian woman. I'm not a religious man, I'm sorry to say, but if God has seen fit to bless you with this gift, you should use it. Bless me? You know what God did for me? He threw a truck at me, bounced me into nowhere for five years! My girl was gone, my job was gone, my legs are useless. Bless me? God's been a real sport to me. All right, John. If you change your mind, you know where I am. Merry Christmas to you. Well? Well what? See? What did I tell you? Them murders, god-awful things. Went on during the time you were in that coma. Don't have the knack for tinsel. It was your mother who kept the tree looking good. I wish to God she was here now so she could talk to you about this thing. I'm not much help to you. Sure you are. You, uh, want to talk about it? Not that much to say. It don't bring you much happiness. When it happens... when the spells come, it feels like... I don't know. It feels like I'm dying... inside. No snow. Hi. I brought you a visitor. I didn't know you were coming. I wasn't sure myself. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have cleaned up. You look wonderful. You lost the crutches, I see. Yeah. I still got the limp. Is your father home? He won't be back till later. Is that who I think it is? His Majesty. - Danny? - Denny. Say hi. Denny. It's cold. Come on in. He's asleep. Last time we were alone together, you said some things were worth waiting for. Well... haven't we waited long enough? Charlene MacKenzie's got Dad building things. If you ask me, it's the company she wants more than the bookcases. I heard that. That's a boy. There you are, young fella. I made that when John was born. It's an excellent chair. What have you two been up to all day? Making bookcases. Sit down. Dinner's ready. That smells good. I'm starved. - I hope you like it. - He's fed up with my cuisine. For our bounty, may the Lord make us grateful. Amen. It feels good to have a family eating around this table again. Will I see you again? Not like today. Go inside, you're freezing. - It doesn't have to... - Don't say it. Don't say it, Johnny. I'll just say good night. Guess I'll hit the hay. I'm going to watch TV. Good night, son. Despite efforts of police forces, the killer is at large, and is likely to remain so. We spoke to Sheriff Bannerman outside the courthouse. We have no new leads at this time. However, there is the hope that some citizen might have some information that would be very helpful. My line is open. I'd welcome any help we can get. That's all I have to say. Nine murders have been attributed to the Castle Rock Killer, dating back almost 31/2 years. The most recent victim was 15 year old Debbie Linderman, a sophomore at Castle Rock High School. Her partially clad body was found one month ago today. As in the other Castle Rock killings, cause of death was multiple stab wounds. Next on News Eight, sports and weather with Ron, after this message. I'm going to help. What? The sheriff that came here... Bannerman. I'm going to help him. We think the killer hid down at the end of the tunnel there. When the girl came through, the bastard was waiting for her. Kids shouldn't come through here, but they use this as a short cut to school. He stood right here. Found a lot of cigarette butts, same brand. Eight or nine butts here. This help you any? I don't know. Have you got something he might have touched or worn? Frank, give me that package. It's our only real evidence. Found it in the bushes back there. Same brand as the butts. Here. Nothing. I thought I'd feel something, but... Can't say we didn't try. Dispatch to Sheriff Bannerman. Yeah, this is Bannerman. We got another body. Oh... damn it! What's the word? - Is it the Castle Rock Killer? - Hey, Sheriff! What's the word about the robbery? That's the psychic, isn't it? Give us a break. We're trying to do a story here. You'll just have to wait. Looks pretty grim to me. Anyone know who she is? Dodd? I know her. Alma Frechette. She works at the Coffee Pot Cafe. Was this psychic your idea, George? Get these people out of here. Move them back. Move the people back. Knock it off with those cameras. No more. - Dodd! - Yeah? - Nobody comes up here. - You got it, Sheriff. You want to try? Hey, Alma! Hi. What are you doing? Waiting for a smile from you. She knows him. What? She knows him. Why waste a smile on you? You want to see the damndest thing? - What? - Come up to the gazebo. She knows him. All right. What did you want to show me? Gazebo. You like that word, Alma? Come here. Look at this. Jesus! Let go! - Is this your idea of a joke? - No joke. No, no! Wait! You all right? Dodd, give me a hand. I saw him. I was there. - I saw his face. - Who? I stood there and watched him kill that girl. Dodd! - What are you saying? - I did nothing. I stood there and watched him kill that girl. - What are you saying? - Dodd! I stood there. I did nothing. Dodd? Dodd, get up here! He took off in your car. I saw his face. I saw his face. You stay there. Sheriff. I told you to stay by the car. Who's there? I want to talk to your son, Mrs. Dodd. He ain't here. His patrol car is out here. His car's here. He ain't. I saw him in the window. - He ain't home! - I'm coming in. No! Leave my boy alone! You knew. Didn't you? You knew. You... You're a... You're a devil... sent from hell! Yes. Yes. Frank? - No! - Aaah! Ahhh! Hello, John. May I come in? How did you find me? My father? Stopped off to see him. He said you moved to a new town. He's worried about you. And so am I. Don't worry. I'm taking care of myself. It's about time. I'm still your doctor. You're still under my care. We have to... well, stay in touch. Well... How's the, uh... All healed up now? The bullet... went right through me. - It's nothing. - Good. Nice place you have here. It's home. Those headaches are getting worse, aren't they? Three, four times a day sometimes. I brought you some new medication. No! No more pills. It takes time to recover. The healing process is slow. I'm not getting better. I'm getting worse. Isn't that right? All right. Now listen. I've done some research into the area of psychic phenomena. Several cases, such as yours, have been documented. I was surprised to discover. And the pattern is always the same. As the spells, the visions, grow stronger and more powerful, the body weakens. I don't need any research or documentation to see this thing is sucking the life out of you. One look tells me that. You mean I'm going to die? How long? I think we can arrest the process, reverse it even. - How? - Come back with me. - Where? - To the clinic. No. Absolutely no. John, please. You must! So you can study me? No. So I can protect you. You need to be in a controlled environment, John. I want to show you something. Come with me. Cards and letters keep pouring in. What is all this? It's people with lost dogs, lost children, lost lives. You haven't even opened them. I don't have to. They all want reassurance, help, love... things I can't give them. Father sends it. I let it pile up. Why do you keep it? This is why I can't go out... live my life, why I stay locked up here. I'm already living in a controlled environment, Sam. Nothing can touch me here. I'm alone. I'm safe. ""But instead of dying, she shall only fall into... a profound sleep which shall last a hundred years. "" That's my mom. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. John Smith? Hi. I'm Roger Stuart. I'd like to talk to you. Sit down. What can I do for you? Um... it's, uh... It's my boy, my son, Chris. He needs help. I've inquired around. You come highly recommended. What's the matter with him? I wish I knew. He's bright, I know he is, but he won't take part in school. He won't join in. He won't learn. God! He's so shy. You think you could help him? I wouldn't know unless I met him. He wouldn't come with me today. You'd have to come out to the house. No. That's out of the question. It's just not the way I do it. It won't work otherwise. Please. He'll get to know you, then you can bring him here for the lessons. Please. Okay. Great. Tomorrow morning's Saturday. I'll send a car to pick you up. That reminds me of when I ran for the senate. My opponent went to the ghetto and handed out dollar bills trying to buy votes. I said, ""You folks keep that money 'cause times is rough. But I want you to vote for whoever you please. "" - We won by... what? - 29. 29 percentage points. Those people spent that money with a clear conscience. John, good morning. Nice to see you. Gentlemen, meet my son's tutor, John Smith. - This is Greg Stillson. - Hello. - This gentleman is... - Sonny Elliman. Well, Greg, you got some good ideas. Let me think about them. Roger, I want you to be part of this. I need your support, your expertise, your input. And most importantly, I need your money. - God bless, Roger. - Thanks for dropping by. See you. Bye-bye. My God! What a glorious day! Amen. Sorry about that. Well, let's go see Chris. Chris. This is Johnny. Remember I said he was coming? I'll leave you alone to get acquainted. Your father wants me to bring you out of your shell. I don't know what to do. You don't have to do anything. My dad lives in a shell, not me. Chris has really taken to you, John. - You made progress. - We just talked. Well, with Chris, that's an achievement. You want a drink? - No. - Want a beer? - Okay. - Get him a beer. Let's listen to this. 99... 100! I'm Greg Stillson, just stopping by on my way to the U.S. Senate. Greg Stillson. Remember you met him this morning? ...you got to be in good shape to go the full distance with those boys in Washington. What the hell is happening to this country? Can anybody tell me? I read in a local paper... Do you believe this guy? He's just getting warmed up. You voting for him? I'm not even registered. - Not registered? - No. Get registered, pal, and vote against this turkey. He's dangerous. ...I see so many unemployed. Why are you people here in the middle of the day? Look at each other! How do you feel? Would you send your friend to the U.S. Senate? A real man of the people. Jesus, what an act. Can't they see through this guy? You acted like friends this morning. With guys like Stillson, you walk a thin line. If they lose, they'll drag you down. But if he wins, and this turkey just might, you make sure you're thought of as a good friend. Know what I mean? ...I've got a job for everyone and a challenge for all of you! I'm challenging you to join me, to join a growing army Let's send Greg Stillson to the U.S. Senate and mediocrity to hell! What can I do for you boys? You work late. That's admirable. I'm Greg Stillson. I know who you are, Mr. Stillson. Take your paid gorilla and get out. We've got a little problem here. Get to the point, Mr. Stillson. I'm damned near even in the polls. The people need me. I'm going to win big. I've had a vision that I'm going to be President of the United States someday. I've accepted that responsibility, and nobody, will stop me. Imagine how I felt when I read your editorial that's hitting the streets tomorrow. You don't seem to like me, Brenner. But that's okay. I don't like you either. How did you get that? I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources. It doesn't make any difference. That editorial is hitting the streets tomorrow morning. Not if we make a deal. What's that mean? You staying out of the campaign business, and me staying out of the publishing business. Show him what we've got to publish. That's your best shot. I got many loyal people on my side... Like that lady in the photograph with you. I never met Mrs. Brenner, but I'm sure that ain't her. What do you think, Sonny? Is this Mrs. Brenner? - Doesn't look like her. - You son of a bitch! Who you calling a son of a bitch? Let's give Mr. Brenner a chance to think about his wife, kids, his position in the community. What if I don't make a deal? You'll make a deal. Otherwise Sonny will take your head off. Good idea. I told you he was a reasonable man. He's a nice man. I like your wife too. ""Prophets, said I, thing of evil. Prophets still of bird or devil, by that heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore, tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aden, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore. "" Skip to the part where he talks about, ""Will I ever see her again?"" ""Eagerly I wish the morrow. Vainly I had sought to borrow from my books, surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore. For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore, nameless here forevermore. "" Stop. I'll be right back. Good afternoon, sir. We're out talking about Greg Stillson. You're familiar with our candidate? What do you think? Yeah, right. Are you aware of what Greg Stillson stands for? Greg Stillson's mounting a successful third party movement. Stillson represents both the poor and the well-off. Could you come back? I have a student. Sure. You're busy. Can I leave some literature? Honey, bring some brochures! Hello, Johnny. Hi. You live here? Yeah. I'm back to teaching. This is my husband Walt. Nice to meet you finally, John. Sarah's talked about you often. Come on back, Johnny. It's no fun reading alone. Chris, Walt and Sarah. Hi. We'll let you get back to work. Nice to meet you. Don't forget who to vote for. Bye. Who was that? Hey. You okay? Why are you crying, Johnny? Johnny? What's the matter? Nothing. - My ride's here. - I'm going with you. - I got to talk to you. - Hi, Johnny. - What are you doing? - Pretty good stuff, huh? I organized a hockey team. We're practicing this afternoon. I'm the coach. Call it off. There's going to be an accident. Call it off? Chris is looking forward to this. - He's really coming out, John. - Wait. I got to talk to you. Eat something, then we'll go. There's going to be an accident. Call it off. We skate on that pond until March. You'll kill your own son! I'm scared, Dad. For Christ sake, John! Don't be scared. Go eat. Don't you know who I am? You think I'd hire you without checking you out? I hired you as a teacher, not a fortuneteller. The ice is going to break! I want you out. I don't want you in my boy's life! You do exactly what I'm telling you! No, Dad. You don't know. It's not safe. All right. To hell with it! Forget everything, but I want you out. Whatever you say. I'm sorry about that. I'll send your final check. I'm not crazy, you know. Don't let the boy think I am. I'm right about this. But we'll never know, will we? Give me your hand. Nothing to worry about now. My driver will take you home. You were right. I'll see you. Chris? Hey, what's going on? You're not even dressed. You called it off. I thought you called it off. Just to get rid of him. We going or not? Are you going to pout like a baby or come and play hockey with your friends? Great. Hello. Who is it? Johnny. - Sarah, see you down there. - Okay. Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Good to see you. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hi. How are you? How you doing? Good to see you. Do it, General. You're insane. I won't. Do it! You'll go down in history with me! As what? The world's greatest mass murderers? You cowardly bastard! You're not the voice of the people! The people speak through me! It came to me while I slept... my destiny. I must get up now and fulfill my destiny! Put your hand on that, or I'll hack it off! Do it! May God forgive me. Congratulations, General. Complete the sequence, Mr. President. My destiny. Thank you, Sonny. Let them come up. Mr. President, we have a diplomatic solution. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, the missiles are flying. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You okay, Greg? Get out! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! Stillson! If you could go back in time to Germany, before Hitler came to power, knowing what you know now, would you kill him? Is that why you sent for me, to ask me this, uh... this question? I have to talk to you, Sam, because I've had another episode. Oh, yes? Go on. I've been tutoring this boy named Stuart. In the vision, I saw him drown. But that's not the point. In the vision, something was missing. How... How do you mean? It was like... a blank spot, a dead zone. First of all, tell me, did the boy in fact drown? His father wanted him to play hockey. I talked him out of it. The boy's alive. Ah. Yes. Don't you see how clear it is? Not only can you see the future, you can... - I can change it. - You can change it, exactly. Here. Yes, John. That is your... your dead zone. The possibility of... of altering the outcome of your premonitions... it's fascinating. Let me make a note. What about my question? Huh? Oh, you mean the one about Hitler? - What would you do? - I don't like this. What are you getting at? What would you do? Would you kill him? All right. All right. I'll give you an answer. I'm a man of medicine. I'm expected to save lives and ease suffering. I love people. Therefore, I would have no choice but to kill the son of a bitch. You'd never get away alive. It doesn't matter. I would kill him. ""Dear Sarah, It is a hard letter to write, so I'll make it short. I can't go on hiding anymore. That's what I've been doing... running and hiding. I had this figured out all wrong. I always thought my power was a curse, but now I can see it's a gift. By the time you get this letter, it'll be all over. You never will understand why. Nobody ever will, but I know what I'm doing. And I know I'm right. Just remember there's never been anyone for me except you. Just wasn't in the cards for us, I guess. I'll always love you, Sarah. Johnny. "" How you doing? Thanks very much. What's your name? Greg, my husband Walt. Hi, Walt. This your baby? Bring him up on stage. I want to thank you for the support you've given this campaign. You made this campaign the most exciting, the most important campaign in this state's history. I've come here personally to thank you for that. Johnny! Give me him! Don't! No! Sonny! The man's trying to kill me! You son of a bitch! Who sent you? Huh? It's over. You're finished. Where's that kid with the camera? I don't see him. You asshole! It's okay. It's all right. Oh, Johnny, why? Why? Good-bye. I love you.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/The_Dead_Zone-85407

I'm sure I left them here somewhere. Leslie! Leslie, what'd you do with my gol-darn golf balls? Fifteen and a half sun block. Father, could I get a string bikini in Florida? Make sure you pack your beach towel. - Nobody can order pizza in this house. - Where are my golf balls? - You know why? 'Cause I'm the only guy... - Check in your pockets.

We don't want to be late for the Christmas pageant. My tie's in the bathroom. I can't go in there, 'cause Uncle Frank's taking a shower. He says if I walked in there and saw him naked, I'd grow up never feeling like a real man. Whatever that means. I'm sure he was kidding. Just run in there and get your tie, get out, and don't look at anything. Well, this cat they're talking about I wonder who could it be 'Cause they know I'm the heaviest cat The heaviest cat you ever did see When they see me walking down the street When the fellas want to speak Hey, hey On their faces they wear a silly smirk 'Cause they know I'm the king of the cool jerk Get out of here, you nosy little pervert, or I'm gonna slap you silly!

Needs just one thing more Christmas tree, my Christmas tree Lit up like... Kevin! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd like to apologize to my family for whatever displeasure I might have caused you. What? My prank was immature and ill-timed. Immature or not, it was pretty gol-darn hilarious. I'd also like to apologize to my brother. Kevin, I'm sorry. Buzz, that was very nice. Kevin, do you have something to say? Beat that, you little trout sniffer. I'm not sorry! I did what I did 'cause Buzz humiliated me. And since he gets away with everything, I let him have it. And since you're all so stupid to believe his lies, I don't care if your idiotic Florida trip gets wrecked or not. Who wants to spend Christmas in a tropical climate anyway? Kevin! Kevin, you walk out of here, you sleep on the third floor. - Yeah, with me. - So what else is new? You'd better not wreck my trip, you little sourpuss. Your dad's paying good money for it. I wouldn't want to spoil your fun, Mr. Cheapskate. What a troubled young man. They're all a bunch ofjerks. Hi. You know, Kevin, last time we all tried to take a trip we had a problem that started just like this. Yeah, with me getting crapped on. I don't care for your choice of words. That's not what happened last time, that's not what's happening this time. Buzz apologized to you. Yeah, then he called me a trout sniffer. He didn't mean what he said. He was just sucking up to you. Okay. Why don't you just sit up here for a while and think things over? When you're ready to apologize to Buzz and to the rest of the family, you can come down. I'm not apologizing to Buzz. I'd rather kiss a toilet seat. Then you can stay up here the rest of the night. Fine. I don't wanna be down there anyway. I can't trust anybody in this family. And d'you know what? If I had my own money, I'd go on my own vacation, alone, without any of you guys. And I'd have the most fun in my whole life. Well, you got your wish last year. Maybe you'll get it again this year. I hope so. - We did it again! - We did it again! Okay, our McCallisters in the first van, the other McCallisters in the second van. I know I shouldn't complain about a free trip, but, jeez, you guys give the worst gol-darn wake-up calls. - Frank, do you have the tickets? - I've got them. - Here's your family's. I've got my family's. - How many do you have? - Seven. - Seven. - Fourteen. - Fourteen. Seven, eight, nine, ten... How come none of us are sitting together? At this time of the year, we're lucky to get on the same plane. Eleven, twelve, thirteen... Where's Kevin? Fourteen. It's a good thing I have my own ticket, just in case you guys try to ditch me. - Come on, Kevin. - Dad, I need batteries. I got some batteries in my bag. I'll give them to you on the plane. - Here's two more. - Why can't I get them now? I can get them. - Not now, Kevin. What's the gate number? - H17, sir. - Here you go. - Thank you. Hey, you better hurry up. It's the last gate. - All the way down. - Wow. - Dad, what gate is it? - H17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin. Kevin, you gonna take my bag? You take my bag? Come on. Come on. Watch it, watch it, watch it. American Airlines flight 226 to New York is now in the final boarding process. Come on, come on. Dad, wait up! Wait up! Wait! - Look out! Look out! - Come on, come on, come on! Dad, wait! Here we are. Here. - We made it all. - Everybody here? We made it? All right. Please, ma'am, you have to board. The plane is ready to leave. - Let me just make sure everyone gets on. - Come on. Don't worry, ma'am, we'll get everybody on the flight. - Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight. - Merry Christmas. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Hey, wait up! Hey, guys, wait for me! - Cutting it kind of close. - Yeah, sorry. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. Dad, wait up! Wait! I'm sorry. - That's all right. Are you on this flight? - Yeah, so is my family. They're already on the plane, and I don't want to be left behind. - Do you have a boarding pass? - It's somewhere. We have to close up here. They're ready to go. - He dropped his boarding pass. - This plane can't leave. This happened to me last year and almost wrecked my Christmas. Are you sure your family's on this flight? Yeah. My dad ran in here right before I bumped into this lady. Okay, board him, but make sure he locates his family before you leave him. Okay. Come on. Do you see your family? - There's my dad over there. - Okay. Well, go find an empty seat. - Have a merry Christmas. - You, too. Ladies and gentlemen, in order for the captain to push back from the gate, we need all passengers to be seated with their seat belts securely fastened. So, have you ever been to Florida? Welcome aboard American Airlines flight 176 nonstop to New York... Boy, I didn't think we were going to make it. Something wrong? Honey? I have that feeling. We forgot something? No, I don't think we did, but I... I just have that feeling. Bad memories, that's all. We did everything, we brought everything, we have everybody. There's nothing to worry about. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. We're fine. Nothing to worry about. Mom? Dad? Uncle Frank? Buzz? - We're the last ones off the plane. - Okay, thanks. Where are those guys? - Whose is this? - That's Brooke's. This is Megan's. Brooke. Give this to Brooke. - This to Kevin. Give this to Kevin. - Give this...

What? Kevin! Excuse me, but this is an emergency. - Yes, sir? - What city is that over there? - That's New York, sir. - Yikes, I did it again. Something wrong, sir? I'll be fine. Oh, no. My family's in Florida and I'm in New York. My family's in Florida. I'm in New York. Thanks! Bye! Wow. What's the child's name? - Kevin. K-E-V-l-N. - Kevin. - When did you see him last? - Curbside check-in? No, I saw him at the door. He was with us in the terminal. Most people get separated at security checkpoints. - Did everyone get through security? - I don't know. Peter? We were in a hurry. We were in a hurry. We had to run all the way to the gate. When did you notice he was missing? When we picked up our baggage here. Has the boy ever run away from home? - No. - No. Has he ever been in a situation where he's been on his own? As a matter of fact, this has happened before. It's becoming sort of a McCallister family travel tradition. Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage. He was left at home by accident last year. Yeah, that's what my wife meant when she said it's becoming a McCallister family travel tradition. We'll call Chicago and notify them of the situation. - The odds are that's where he is. - Thanks. It's very unlikely he'd be anywhere else. Watch out, kid! Yo, where's your manifest? Here we are, Marv. New York City, the land of opportunity. - Smell that? - Yeah. - You know what that is? - Fish. - It's freedom. - No, it's fish. - It's freedom, and it's money. - Okay, okay. It's freedom. Come on, let's get out of here before somebody sees us. And it's fish. Yup, one quick score. We get ourselves a couple of phony passports and we hightail it to some foreign country. Arizona? That's very smart, Marv. You bust out of jail to rob 14 cents from a Santa Claus? Every little bit helps. Besides, now we got our new nickname. We're the Sticky Bandits. Real cute. Very cute. ""The Plaza Hotel, New York's most exciting hotel experience."" Sick. - What's the matter? - Thought I saw something. Serves you right. Come on, let's go! I think she likes me. Excuse me. Where's the lobby? - Down the hall and to the left. - Thanks. Wow! Guests of the new Celebrity Ding Dang Dong stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel, New York's most exciting hotel experience.

Hi. - Can I help you? - Reservation for McCallister? A reservation for yourself? Ma'am, my feet are hardly touching the ground. I'm barely able to look over this counter. How could I make a reservation for a hotel room? Think about it, a kid going into a hotel, making a reservation? I don't think so. I'm confused. I'm traveling with my dad. He's on business. He's at a meeting. I hate meetings, plus I'm not allowed to go in. I can only sit in the lobby. That's boring. So my dad dropped me off here. He gave me his credit card and said whoever was checking people in to let me in the hotel room so I won't get into mischief, and, ma'am, sometimes I do get into mischief. We all do. Merry Christmas. No sign of him. We're gonna have to be able to get a hold of you. - You have hotel arrangements? - Yeah. Do you have a recent photo of the boy? I have one in my wallet. I don't have my wallet. My wallet's in my bag. Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport. He was looking for batteries. Kevin has my wallet. - Did you have credit cards in the wallet? - Credit cards, money. We'll notify the credit card companies immediately. If your son has the cards, we can get a location on him when and if he uses them. No, I don't think Kevin even knows how to use a credit card. Wow! It worked. - Cedric. - Yes? - Don't count your tips in public. - I'm sorry. And find out everything you can about that young fellow. Front, please. Enjoy your stay with us. And don't forget to remind your dad when he arrives that he has to come down and sign a couple of things. Thank you. You've been most helpful. May I take your bag, sir? Up here to your left. You know, Herbert Hoover once stayed here on this floor. - The vacuum guy? - No, the president. This is one of our finest suites, sir. This is great! Wow! A huge bed just for me! Luxurious and spacious. How convenient! Hey! Did you want me to put the key in the bag or did you just want to hang on to it? I'll hang on to it. Is everything all right, sir? - Is the temperature in the room okay? - It's okay. - Do you know how the TV works? - I'm 10 years old. TV's my life. Well... I'm sorry. And there's plenty more where that came from. Thank you. Would it bother anyone if I worked on my cannonballs? No. Thanks. Yikes! This is a vacation. Hold it right there. It's me, Johnny. I knew it was you. I could smell you getting off the elevator. - Two scoops, sir? - Two? Make it three. I'm not driving. It's gardenias, Johnny, your favorite. Thank you. You was here last night, too, wasn't you? I was singin' at the Blue Monkey last night. She was not! She was smooching with your brother. You was here, and you was smooching with my brother! - That's a dirty, rotten lie, Johnny. - See? Don't give me that. You been smooching with everybody! Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Mo with the gimpy leg, Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff, I could go on forever, baby. - You got me all wrong. - All right. I believe you, but my Tommy gun don't! Johnny! You're the only duck in my pond! Get down on your knees and tell me you love me. Baby! I'm over the moon for you! You got to do better than that! If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have to take two airplanes to get across it! Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you. That's why I'm gonna let you go. I'm going to give you to the count of three to get your lousy, lying, lowdown, four-flushing carcass out my door! She's rat bait. One, two, three! Merry Christmas, you filthy animal. And a happy New Year. Housekeeping. We know a cat who can really do the cool jerk Well, this cat they talkin' about I wonder who could it be 'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat The heaviest cat you ever did see When they see me walkin' down the street When the fellas want to speak Hey, hey On their faces, they wear a silly smirk 'Cause they know I'm the king of the cool jerk Get out of here, you nosy little pervert, or I'm gonna slap you silly! You're cooking, Frankie! Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon. Hey! Uncle Rob lives here. If they're back from Paris, I'll drop in on them. They usually give pretty good presents. Good night, Mom. Good night, Kevin. Your drawers, sir. Jeez! Don't flash these babies around here! - There could be girls on this floor! - I was very careful, sir. You can't be too careful when it involves underwear. - I understand. - I'm sorry. You wanted a tip. That won't be necessary, sir. I still have some tip left over. No tip? Okay. No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Excuse me, how do I get to Columbus Circle? The doorman will be happy to find you a taxi, sir. Mr. McCallister! - Excuse me. - Sure. And how are we this morning? - Fine. Is my transportation here? - Out in front, sir. A limousine and a pizza, compliments of the Plaza Hotel. I do hope your father understands that last night I was simply checking the room to make sure everything was in order. - He was pretty mad. - He was? He said he didn't come all the way to New York - to get his naked rear end spied on. - Of course not. - Will he be down soon? - He already left. I would have liked to have offered my personal apology. If some guy looked at you in the shower, would you ever want to see him again? I suppose not. I don't think you'll see him for the rest of our trip. I understand. Bye. Have a lovely day. McCallister. - Morning, Mr. McCallister. - Good morning. Mr. McCallister, here's your very own cheese pizza. - Hello? - Hello. - Know any good toy stores? - Yes, sir! Bingo! Get out of here! Go on, get out! Get out of here! Go on. Get out of here! Beat it, beat it, beat it! Get out of here! Hey, Marv! Get over here! I got to talk to you! Whoa! Whoa! - Would you like a scarf? - You wanna forget about the scarf, Marv? We got to talk. We don't have the equipment to pull off anything big, you know, your banks, your jewelry stores. We don't want goods. We need cash, and we need it now. How about hotels? Tourists carry lots of cash. There's no guarantees. I got a better idea. Stores ain't gonna deposit cash on Christmas Eve. The only stores that are gonna have cash on hand are the ones that deal in moderate-priced goods. Right, right. Ergo, what store's gonna make the most cash on Christmas Eve that nobody's going to think to rob? Candy stores. Nine-year-olds rob candy stores, Marv. This is what I had in mind. That's brilliant, Harry. Brilliant! Yep. There's nobody dumb enough to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve. Yes, there is. Here we are, sir, Duncan's Toy Chest. Merry Christmas, Kevin. This is the greatest accident of my life. Marv. Marv! Hey, nice house, but there's no bathroom in it. - All right, so what's the plan? - Everybody leaves for a nice holiday off. We come out of our little houses... - Yeah, then what? - We empty the registers - and walk out like we own the joint. - Great plan, Harry! Shake his hand. Well, now, thank you and merry Christmas. Say hello to the family. Yes. Let me see. You shopping alone? In New York? Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow. - Now, I was just checking. - That's very responsible of you. - Well, thank you. - My pleasure. That'll be $23.75. My, my, my! Where did you get all that money? I have a lot of grandmothers. Well, that explains it. This is a really nice store, one of the finer toy dealerships I've ever visited in my life. - Well, thank you. - This Mr. Duncan must be a pretty nice guy letting all the kids come into his store and play with all his toys. Most toy stores prohibit that, you know. - Is that so? - Yep. Well, he loves kids. As a matter of fact, all the money the store takes in today, Mr. Duncan is donating it to the children's hospital. And the day after Christmas, we empty out all the money in the cash register and Mr. Duncan just takes it right down to the hospital. - That's very generous of him. - Well, children bring him a lot ofjoy. As they do to everyone who appreciates them. I'm not supposed to spend this money, but I have $20 from shoveling snow in a jar in our garage where my older brother can't find it. So I can pay my mother back with that. So you can give this to Mr. Duncan. The hospital needs it more than I do. Besides, I'm probably gonna spend it on stuff that'll rot my teeth and my mind. That's very sweet of you. You see that tree there? Well, to show our appreciation for your generosity, I'm going to let you select an object from that tree that you can take home with you. - For free? - Yeah. - May I make a suggestion? - Okay. Take the turtledoves. - I could have two? - Well, two turtledoves. And I'll tell you what you do. You keep one, and you give the other one to a very special person. You see, turtledoves are a symbol of friendship and love. Now, as long as each of you have your turtledove, you'll be friends forever. Wow! I never knew that. I thought they were just part of a song. They are, and for that very special reason. Wow! Thanks. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, too. Be sure to bundle up if you go outside. It's a little nippy. Thank you, I'll do that. Well, where to? Well, you promised you'd take me to the Central Park Zoo. Hey! Look who it is, Marv. Come on. Let's get him. Hey! Hiya, pal. Come on! Hey! Hey! Watch it, man! Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush. Two for $5, two for $5. Four for 10. - All right, kiddo. - There he is! All right, kiddo! - Thanks. - Merry Christmas. - Hey, hey! - Whoa! Excuse me! Yes! - Thank you for your suggestion. - My duty, my pleasure. Bye now. You got to help me! There's two guys after me! What's the matter? Store wouldn't take your stolen credit card? Let's see what the police have to say about this. Get up! Get up! Come on! Let's go get him! Get back here, you little thief! Stop that child! Grab him! You little... I've committed credit card fraud. Get me security! We've got to stop that delinquent! Come along, Cedric. I've had enough of this vacation. I'm going home. Hold it right there. This is the concierge, sir. I knew it was you. I could smell you getting off the elevator. You was here last night, too, wasn't you? Yes, sir, I was. You was here, and you was smooching with my brother! I'm... I'm afraid you're mistaken, sir. Don't give me that. You been smooching with everybody! Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Mo with the gimpy leg, Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff... No! It's a lie! I could go on forever, baby. I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I'm afraid you're mistaken. We're looking for a young man. All right. I believe you, but my Tommy gun don't! Get down on your knees and tell me you love me. On your knees. I love you. You got to do better than that! - I love you! - I love you! Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you. That's why I'm gonna let you go. I'm going to give you to the count of three to get your lousy, lying, lowdown, four-flushing carcass out my door! - One... - Open up the door! Two, three! Merry Christmas, you filthy animal. And a happy New Year. Stay in your rooms! This is an emergency! There's an insane guest with a gun! No! Come to Papa! Round trip to Miami. What's the matter, get on the wrong plane, squirt? Looks like you won't be needing this, kid. American don't fly to the promised land, little buddy. Come on! We spent nine months in jail thinking we had the worst luck in the universe. We were wrong, little buddy. We're busted out of the clink, and we're doing fine. We're gonna be doing even better because we're not robbing houses anymore. Now we're robbing toy stores. At midnight tonight, we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest. Five floors of cash. Then after that, we grab a couple of phony passports... - Marv! Marv, you want to shut up? - What's the difference? He's not going to talk to anybody except maybe a fish. Or the undertaker. Let's just get him to the subway tunnel. I'll feel a lot better once we get him on ice. I've got a gun in my pocket. You open your mouth, and you'll be spitting gum out through your forehead. Well, hello. - He did it! - Did what? Thanks! - Get him, will you! - He went in the park. What are you doing flirting? Get him. Over there! - Quit it! Hey! - Creep! - Give me that! - What are you doing? - Hey, Harry. - What? - I got him. - Wait, let me see. That ain't him. Get down. Put him down. Put him down. That ain't him. We should've shot him when we had the chance. I hate pulling a job, knowing that little creep is on the loose. What can he do? He's a kid. Kids are helpless. - Not this kid. - Yeah, but this time he doesn't have a house full of dangerous goodies to get us with. He's in the Park. He's alone. Kids are scared of the Park. Yeah. Grown men come in the Park and don't leave alive. Yeah. Good luck, little fella. I want to go home. Mom, where are you? Turn that down! - Hello? - Kate McCallister, please. - This is she. - Ma'am, we found your son. - Oh, my God! - What? - It's the police. They know where Kevin is. - What? - Where? - He's in New York City. - He's in New York! - New York? ...your husband's credit cards... - What? Well, I'm sure he was scared. He's not a troublemaker. - What? What? - Ma'am, the New York police... - Just a second. Please hold. - Yes, I'll hold... He used your credit card to check into the Plaza Hotel. - Do they still have him? - Do they have him? - No, the police are still looking for him. - Damn it! Get to New York as soon as possible, ma'am. Yeah, okay, we're on the next flight out. Thank you. We're going to New York, move it! - Yes! - Party time! He ran away from the hotel when they questioned him about the card. He must be so scared, Peter! I wonder if he'd know enough to go to my brother's place? - Aren't they in Paris? - Maybe they have a house sitter. I thought you said they were renovating? Hello? Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette! Anybody home? Hello! Anybody home? It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin! Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette! Watch it, kid! Hey, you looking for somebody to read you a bedtime story? Taxi! Boy, it's scary out there. Ain't much better in here, kid. I don't want to ever take a vacation like this again. Where did all you guys come from? I don't know if I have enough for everybody. How hungry are you guys? You guys ate all my food. Look, I'm sorry I screamed in your face. You were just trying to help me, right? I'm Kevin McCallister. Your birds are real nice. I've seen you before. You had pigeons all over you. At first, you look kind of scary, but when I think about it, it's not so bad. They must be all over you 'cause they like you. If I'm bothering you, I can leave. Am I bothering you? No. Good. I'm not a pain in the butt? No. Will those pigeons come back on their own or do you have to call them? Give me your hand. They can hear it. This is great! It's pretty cold out. I could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate. How about you? My treat. I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve in such a park. Can we go someplace warm? Yes. I know a place. Nice music. This place is great. I've heard the world's great music from here. Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie. Frank Sinatra. Luciano Pavarotti. So, do you bring your friends up here? - I haven't got many friends. - Sorry. I'm like the birds I care for. People pass me in the street. They see me but they try to ignore me. They prefer I wasn't part of their city. Yeah. It's sort of like that with my family. I'm kind of the pigeon of the house just because I'm the youngest. Everyone fights for position. Everybody wants to be seen and heard. I guess so. I'm seen and heard pretty much. But then I get sent to my room a lot, too. I wasn't always like this, you know. What were you like before? I had a job. I had a home. I had a family. - Did you have any kids? - No. Oh, I wanted them. But the man I loved fell out of love with me. That broke my heart. And whenever the chance to be loved came along again, I ran away from it. I stopped trusting people. No offense, but that seems like sort of a dumb thing to do. I was afraid of getting my heart broken again. You see, sometimes you can trust a person, and then, when things are down, they forget about you. Maybe they're just too busy. Maybe they don't forget about you, but they forget to remember you. I don't think people mean to forget. I think it just happens. My grandfather says if my head wasn't screwed on, I'd leave it on the school bus. I'm just afraid if I do trust someone, I'll get my heart broken again. I understand that. I used to have this really nice pair of rollerblades. I was afraid if I wore them, I'd wreck them. So I kept them in a box. - Do you know what happened? - No. I outgrew them. I never wore them once outside. I just wore them in my room a couple times. A person's heart and a person's feelings are very different than skates. Well, they're kind of the same thing. If you aren't going to use your heart, then what's the difference if it gets broken? If you just keep it to yourself, maybe it'll be like my rollerblades. When you do decide to try it, it won't be any good. You should take a chance. Got nothing to lose. A bit of truth in there somewhere. I think so. Your heart might still be broken, but it isn't gone. If it was gone, you wouldn't be this nice. Thank you. Do you know that it's been a couple of years since I've talked to anybody? That's okay. You're really good at it. You're not boring. You don't mumble or spit when you talk. You should do it more often. I think you just have to wear an outfit that doesn't have pigeon poop on it. I have been working very hard at keeping people away, haven't I? I always think I'll have a lot of fun if I'm alone, but when I'm alone, it isn't that much fun at all. I don't care how much people bug me sometimes, I'd rather be with somebody than by myself. So what are you doing running around the streets on Christmas Eve on your own? Did you get into trouble? - Yeah. - You've done something wrong? A lot of things. Did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed? It's getting pretty late. I don't know if I'll have enough time to do all the good deeds I need to erase all the bad ones I did. Well, it's Christmas Eve. Good deeds count for extra tonight. - They do? - Of course they do. So what you must do now is you must think of the most important thing that you can do for others and go and do it. Just follow the star in your own heart. Okay. It's getting pretty late. I'd better get going. If I don't see you again, I hope everything turns out okay. Thank you. - Say goodbye to your birds for me. - I will. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. If you need somebody to trust, it can be me. I won't forget to remember you. Don't make promises you can't keep. All the money in the cash registers, Mr. Duncan is going to donate to the Children's Hospital. At midnight tonight, we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest. You can mess with a lot of things, but you can't mess with kids on Christmas. We'd like to offer you a complimentary suite while you're here. It's a penthouse with a view of the Park. I think you'll find it satisfactory. It was recently vacated by the Countess of Worcestershire. What kind of hotel allows a child to check in alone? The boy had a very convincing story. What kind of idiots do you have working here? The finest in New York. Well, I mean, when you discovered that the credit card was stolen... I made the discovery. Why did you let him leave? - We attempted to confront him, he ran. - You scared him away. It's Christmas Eve, and because of you, our child is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world. Now could you take our family and our luggage up to the room, please. - Yes, sir! - Run along, Cedric. I'm going to go down to the police station and make sure that they're doing everything in their power to find Kevin. I want you to stay here with Frank, Leslie and the kids. - No, I'm going out to look for him. - What? With all due respect, madam, your son is lost in one of the biggest cities in the world. Could you stay out of this please? - As you wish. - Thank you. I don't think it's a good idea for you to start running around - all over New York City all by yourself. - I think if our son can do it, I can do it. - Kate... - Peter, I'll be fine. The way I'm feeling right now, no mugger or murderer would dare mess with me. Madam, there are hundreds of parasites out there armed to the teeth! Do bundle up. It's awfully cold outside. Marv. Marv. Come on, let's go. Marv. Crowbars up! Merry Christmas, Harry! Happy Hanukkah, Marv! Oh, this is more money than I can even count! It makes you wonder why we spent so much time robbing private homes. The amazing thing is, we're fugitives from the law, we're up to our elbows in cash and there's nobody that even knows about it. He's back! - He took our picture! - How did my hair look? This is it. No turning back. Another Christmas in the trenches. No! Wow. That's it! Get the money! Get the money! I'll kill him! That little... - I'm coming, Harry! - Marv! Harry? Harry! That was incredible. - I twisted my ankle on that board there. - Where is he? Hey, guys! Smile! Come on! Come on! - Help me. - I got you. I got you. Taxi! Times Square. Where'd he go? I'm up here! Come and get me! - Let's kill! - Hold on, pea-brain. We got busted last time because we underestimated that little bundle of misery. This ain't like the last time. This ain't his house. The kid's running scared. He ain't got a plan. May I do the thinking, please? Thank you. - Sonny! - Yes? Nothing would thrill me more greatly than to shoot you. Knocking off a youngster ain't going to mean all that much to me. Understand? But since we're in a hurry, I'll make a deal with you. You throw down your camera and we won't hurt you. You'll never hear from us again. Okay? - You promise? - I cross my heart and hope to die. Okay! Okay, kid, give it to me. Direct hit! How many fingers am I holding up, Marv? Eight? Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks? Go ahead, throw another one. Don't do that! If you can't do any better than that, kid, you're going to lose. Harry, no. You got any more? Come on, Marv. Get up. He don't have any more bricks. He's out of them. What? That did it! Nobody throws bricks at me and gets away with it. Come on, Marv. Get up. You go this way. I'm going round the back. Harry? Harry! I've reached the top! You gotta do better than this, kid. Wow! What a hole. Whoa! Harry. I'm coming up! I'm going to murder that kid! Yes! Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Hey! Don't you know a kid always wins against two idiots? Harry! He's in the living room! He went up the ladder! I'm coming, Harry. I'm coming. Harry! Harry! You didn't lose any teeth! Come on, he went to the second floor. Hey! Why don't you guys try the stairs? Right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't you remember what happened last year? - No. - Watch this. Let's get him! He busted me right in my mouth, Marv! That's one. Don't worry, Harry. I'll get him. Right in the schnoz. That's two. Come on, let's get him. That's three. No. That's four. - Come on, Harry. - Marv, are you sure this is safe? Oh yeah. Yep, I've worked all the kinks out. It's solid as a rock. - Like a rock, huh, Marv? - Hey? Do you guys give up? - Have you had enough pain? - Never! You better say every prayer you ever heard before, kid! I hope your parents got you a tombstone for Christmas. - Where'd he go? - I'm up here and I'm really scared. What's that sound? That was the sound of a tool chest falling down the stairs. Yes! Over there! I don't care if I get the chair, I'm killing that kid! Surrender, kid! - He vanished. - I'm down here, you big horse's ass! - Whoa. - Nice night for a neck injury! Suck brick, kid! - Come on, Marv. - Oh, I don't know. I said, come on. Come on, you big sissy. Harry? You wearing aftershave? That's not aftershave. That's kerosene. The rope is soaked in it. Now, why would anybody soak a rope in kerosene? Merry Christmas. Go up! Get off me! Get the bag! Hello, the two guys who robbed Duncan's Toy Chest are in the park. Central Park West, 95th Street. Look for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun. Hey, I'm down here. Better come and get me before I call the cops. My, how the tables have turned. How do you like the ice, kid? Let's go for a little stroll in the park. Give me that bag. Give me it! Hey, these'll look great in the photo album. You may've won the battle, little dude, but you lost the war. You ought not have messed with us, pal. We're dangerous. - Harry? - Shut up! - Harry. - Shut up! I want to enjoy this. - Something's wrong. Let's get out of here! - Shut up, I said! I never made it to the 6th grade, kid, and it doesn't look like you're going to, either. Let him go! Kevin, run! Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her! I'm trying to shoot her! Run, Marv! Bye! Thanks. Jesus, looks like the 4th of July! - Okay, let's go. - We'll take the bridge. You guys get the tunnel. Let's go. Come on! Oh, my God! All right, guys, let's go, huh? - Come on, on your feet. - Take it easy. What is this stuff? You guys should've started earlier. The prisoners have already exchanged gifts. We missed the presents? He made us hide out in the store so we could steal all the kiddies' charity money. Shut up, Marv. Got the right to remain silent, you know. He's a little cranky. We just broke out of prison a few days ago. Shut up, Marv! Jeez. - Get them out of here! - All right, let's go. Remember, if this makes the papers, we're no longer the Wet Bandits, we're the Sticky Bandits. We're not Sticky Bandits, shut up! - That's Sticky. That's S... - Shut it. ...T... - I. ...I... Well, Mr. Duncan, it's all over with. We apprehended the thieves and we recovered your money. Good, I want to get that money over to the Children's Hospital as soon as possible. - I'll handle it personally. My pleasure. - Thank you very much. - Excuse me, Mr. Duncan. - Yes. I found this note. Looks like a kid broke your window. Turtledoves. Excuse me. I'm looking for my son. He's this boy right here. Excuse me. Please help me. This boy right here. Have you seen him? This one, he's... Please. I'm looking for my son. Have you seen my son? He's... There. He's been missing for two days. - Well, have you filed a report, ma'am? - Yes, of course we have. Then trust us. We'll handle it. But I'm his mother. I realize that, ma'am, but you're looking for a needle in a haystack. - Do you have kids? - Yes, ma'am. And what would you do if one of them was missing? I'd probably be doing the same thing you're doing. Thank you. Look, put yourself in your kid's shoes. Where would you go? What would you do? Me? I'd probably be lying dead in a gutter somewhere. Oh, but not Kevin. No. Kevin is so much stronger and braver than I am. I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is. Fine. But he's still all by himself in a big city. And he doesn't deserve that. He deserves to be at home with his own family around his Christmas tree. Oh, dear God, I know where he is. I need to get to Rockefeller Center. - Hop in. - Thank you. I know I don't deserve a Christmas even if I did do a good deed. I don't want any presents. Instead, I want to take back every mean thing I ever said to my family, even if they don't take back the things that they said. I don't care. I love all of them. Including Buzz. If it isn't possible I can see all of them, could I just see my mother? I'll never want another thing as long as I live. I just want my mother. I know I won't see her tonight, but promise me I can see her again. Sometime. Anytime. Even if it's just once and only for a couple of minutes. I just need to tell her I'm sorry. Kevin? Mom? Wow! That worked fast! Oh, Kevin. Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. Merry Christmas, Mom. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Thank you. Let's go. How'd you know I was here? Well, I know you and Christmas trees, and this is the biggest one around. - Where's everybody else? - They're at the hotel. They didn't like palm trees either. Holy smokes, it's morning! It's Christmas morning, man. Fuller, don't get your hopes up. I don't think Santa Claus visits hotels. Are you nuts? He's omnipresent. He goes everywhere. Hey, guys, wake up, it's Christmas! - Mom! Dad! It's Christmas! - What? - Wow. - Wow. - Where'd it all come from? - Mom! Dad! You got to see this! - My gosh! - Peter! Are you sure we're in the right room? Don't open any of mine. I mean it. - Who's Mr. Duncan? - Duncan? I don't know. All right, everyone, just calm down. Calm down! Hey! Hey! All right. Now, if Kevin hadn't screwed up in the first place, again, then we wouldn't be in this most perfect and huge hotel room with a truckload of all this free stuff. So, I think it only fair that Kevin get to open up the first present. Then I'll go and the rest of you and so on. - Merry Christmas, Kev. - Merry Christmas, Buzz. - Merry Christmas, Kevin. - Okay, Kevin! All right! Merry Christmas! Enough of this gooey... Show of emotion. Everyone, let's dig in! All right! Everybody, now, wait, save the paper. We can use it next year. And the bows. Give me the bows... Merry Christmas. Kevin! Merry Christmas! I got something for you. - What's this? - It's a turtledove. I have one. You have one. As long as we each have a turtledove, we'll be friends forever. Oh, Kevin. Thank you. I won't forget you. Trust me. Mr. McCallister's room service bill, sir. Merry Christmas, sir. Nice family. Really. Merry Christmas indeed. Oh, Dad! Kevin! You spent $967 on room service?

The Last Picture Show (1971) - full transcript,"In 1951, a group of high schoolers come of age in a bleak, isolated, atrophied North Texas town that is slowly dying, both culturally and economically.","President Truman will be here tomorrow, so you folks in Dallas turn out. This is Cowboy Rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls. Here's Hank Williams' hit tune, ""Cold, Cold Heart."" You ain't ever gonna amount to nothing. Already spent a dime this morning, ain't even had breakfast. Give me the chalk. Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny? It sticks up. I'm surprised you had the nerve to show up... ...after that stomping you took last night. What'd you say? Could've been worse. Yeah. You can say that about everything. A few teams have had some luck with tackling. Keeps the other team from scoring so often. Sounds too rough for me. You don't care if it was your last game. You'll never get stomped for your high school ball team again. - Where's your school spirit? - Don't know. You working today? The truck's being greased. See, this is what I get for betting on my own hometown ball team. I ought to have better sense. Wouldn't hurt if you had a better hometown. Mind pointing that at the floor till I get by? I don't want my eye poked out. Don't let Billy get too far away. You're damn more dangerous in a pool hall than on a football field. You ever heard of tackling? Hey, Duane! Boy, I froze my ass last night! Why can't you kids learn to tackle? How about taking Genevieve some change, as you're going that way? Toss me one! Look, Larry, they can catch. Feisty sons of bitches. Wish they could tackle. Or do something useful. Team wasn't worth a kiss-my-ass this year. Fade out, Crawford. One more time. All right, you boys. Cut it out. I got enough problems without you playing that game. We could've run off to Mexico with this, you know. - Play the new one we heard. - Which one? Down payment on breakfast. Let someone rich play the jukebox. Nobody rich would eat here. - I ain't very hungry. - Well, I am. You want the pickup first? I oughtn't always get it first. It's half yours. - Go ahead. - You sure? Yes. Anyways, I got lots of deliveries to make. And I have to go clear to Ranger. I'll be lucky to get back for the second show. My goodness, Sonny. Frank oughtn't work you so late on weekends. That's what I tell him. You ain't got in in time to see the comedy in three weeks. Hope you don't want popcorn. There ain't none. And you missed the newsreel too. The main show's done started, so I'll just charge you 30 cents. Thanks, Miss Mosey. I was wondering if my daughter had deserted us, when I heard her voice. Kay was our only daughter. A father's not supposed to have favourites, but when it's Kay... - You smell good. - You like it? - What's that? - An atomizer. What'd you get? A present? Who from? Somebody. I decided you had a wreck. What's happened? You look different. - I do? - Yeah. You look all lit up inside. You're not wearing your usual deadpan look. That ""How'd I get into this family?"" look. Father. You've been taking the vitamins Dr. Gray sent you. That's right. I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins. I'll get it, Delilah. What's wrong? She looks kind of queer. Guess what? What? It's our anniversary. What? We've been going steady a year tonight. Yeah? Seems like a lot longer. You should've got me some anniversary present. You can have another stick of gum. That's all I got. You can give me the dollar it cost me and Marlene for the show. What are y'all doing back here in the dark? He's coming for me soon. I'll get your coffee. Where'd the boys go? Ben had some date. Tommy's at basketball practice. - Bring the coffee, please. - Yes, Miss Banks. I don't see why they should get the pickup first all the time. All they ever want to do is neck anyway. Buckley says it's not too young for a man to marry. I didn't marry your mother till I was 25. - Need some help, Jessie? - Yeah, sure do. - So long, Sam. - Bye. - Sure did like the picture. - Well, good. Crack your window. Leave the motor on. It's just too cold in here. Your hands are like ice. Put on my gloves. What's the matter with you? You act plain bored. Quit. Quit. You said this was our anniversary. Let's do something different. Well, I like that. You cheapskate. Didn't get me a present, and now you want to get me pregnant. My God, Charlene! It was just my hand. One thing leads to another. My mama told me how that old stuff goes. We'll have plenty of time for that when we get married. You wasn't no livelier than me. Because you ain't good-looking enough. You ain't even got a ducktail. Well, anyway, I'm done late. Let's go on home. Some anniversary. If that's the way you feel about it, I'd just as soon break up. I don't want to spoil no more anniversaries for you. That's the way nice girls get treated. I might've known you wasn't dependable. You wasn't even in the backfield. This jacket's got a hole, but don't ask me to sew it for you. Give me back my pictures too. I don't want you showing them and telling how hot I am. You wasn't very hot. I hope you ain't down about Charlene. - I ain't blue about her. - What are you blue about then? Ain't nobody to go with in this town. Jacy's the only pretty girl in school, and Duane's got her. I'd call that his tough luck. You don't have to eat so fast. You ain't in a race. Jacy'd bring you more misery than she'll ever be worth. Did your dad give you this? He needs all he's got. Wouldn't hurt you to take something from him once in a while. I don't know. You and Duane both in a boarding house. Him with the mother and you with the father. Don't seem right. And your dad's taking too many pills, you know. But I'm no one to talk. I never got on with Mama. I still don't. I hear Dan's going back to work soon. I guess you'll be quitting before long. We got $4000 worth of doctor bills to pay. I will probably be making cheeseburgers for your grandkids. What are my chances this morning of interesting you kids in John Keats? None at all. Joe Bob? I read that poem of his about the nightingale. I didn't think it was so good. Sounded like he wanted to be a nightingale. I don't think he wanted to be a nightingale, Joe Bob. Maybe he just wanted to be immortal. All you have to do to be immortal is lead a good Christian life. Anyone can do it if they love the Lord. Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so. Here now, let me read you this: When old age shall this generation waste Thou shalt remain in midst of other woe ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,""... that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. Run, you little pissants, run! Tough it out! You gotta be men like the rest of us. None of you pretty enough to be women. Here, Joe Bob. Quit flapping your arms. You look like a damn goose. Even a preacher's boy ought to be in shape. What kind of female will you ever get? Tough it out! Run, you little pissants. All right, off the court. If y'all didn't jack off so much, maybe you could stay in shape. Come here a minute, Sonny. You do me a favour, and I'll do you one. Sure, coach. My old lady's got to go to the doctor tomorrow. You know women. Always something wrong. I guess. Take it from me. Anyway, I don't have time to drive her. Now, if you'll do this for me, I'll get you out of civics class. I'll be glad to. The best offer I've had all day. Tell her you got to get back for practice so she won't stay too long. I've got enough bills to pay already. "" Know what the trouble is with you? You ain't got no school spirit."" You need a haircut. Come on, Jimmie Sue. We're hungry over here too. I'm coming. Hold your horses! Better watch it. Here comes your mama. We're having supper at home tonight. I expect you there in 15 minutes, you hear? Okay, Mama. I was just giving the boys a ride. Here's a tune that's been on the hit list for some weeks. Tell us the name. What is it? What is it, huh? - ""Shrimp Boats."" - You got it! Very good, Thomas. You were in on that too. There's $120. We're going along fine. Now we come to City Limits. This is... Guess you hate me tonight. I love you, but I love Duane too. Even if you don't like it. I don't care. I'd just hate to see you marry him. You wouldn't be rich anymore. I don't care about money. You're pretty stupid then. You married Daddy when he was poor, and he got rich, didn't he? Scared your daddy into getting rich, beautiful. If Daddy could do it, Duane could too. Not married to you. You're not scary enough. You're rich and miserable. I don't want to be like you. Not much danger of that. - You slept with him? - Mama! Go to the doctor and arrange something... ...so you don't have to worry about babies. You must be careful. But it's a sin unless you're married. You know I wouldn't do that. Don't be so mealy-mouthed! I thought if you slept with him... ...you might find there isn't anything magic about him. Then we can send you to a good school... I don't want to leave. Why can't I stay and go to college in Wichita Falls? Because. Everything is flat and empty here. And nothing to do! Can I have some of that? Help yourself. Don't you have any? Yeah, but I feel like smelling good right now. Don't you ever feel like doing anything right now? Leave your face just like that. All you need is a little eyebrow pencil. Okay. Good night. Just remember, beautiful, everything gets old if you do it often enough. So if you want to find out about monotony real quick, marry Duane. Number one hit in the country, right here on KTRN... ... your mutual station in Wichita Falls. Our old friend Hank Williams wrote that. You're with us on Strike it Rich. I'd like to remind you that we're on television every day. Also, every morning, we're on radio on another network. Check your paper for times. Strike it Rich Box 500, Grand Central Annex... Hello. - Abilene, you asleep? - No. Feel like company? I thought I'd drive out, see how my well is coming. Drill hard. You're better at oil wells anyway. Hello, Sonny. What you want? Coach said you need a driver. Didn't he tell you? No, he didn't mention it. I thought he'd drive me himself. I guess he just couldn't get off. Let me just get the radio. Is it something bad? No. It's something... ...very... Thank you. Here's the keys. I guess I'd better be getting back to school. It was nice of you to drive me. Well, it beats sitting through civics, ma'am. Wouldn't you like to come in and have a soda? If you can stand me for a few more minutes. I hate these northers. Would you prefer milk? Sit at the table. Or you can go now if you want. I was just scared to be alone. I'm sorry I made you come in. I'll take a Dr Pepper. You'll never forgive me, I know. Go on. You don't have to stay any longer. Thank you for the Dr Pepper. I guess you'll be glad when basketball season's over. Why? Coach probably don't get to stay home much... ...during football and basketball season. My God, you don't know a thing about it, do you? You better go on to basketball practice. Thanks for the Dr Pepper. - Hi, Jacy. - Oh, hi. Duane coming? - You know Bobby Sheen at Wichita Falls? - I met him at the country club. He's having this midnight swimming party tonight. - You want to run over there with me? - I can't. You hear about the last one? His folks were gone to Miami, and everybody swam naked. His folks are gone again, so it'll be pretty wild. Sure wish you could come. Bobby has great parties. A lot of kids from the club gonna be there. Gee, Lester, I'd like to go. I'll have a big problem with Duane, though. Well, don't go off without me. Maybe I can. Hi, Duane. What did Lester want? Oh, Lester. He's such a bore. - Hey, Abilene. - What do you say, buddy? Hey there. Merry Christmas. This is Jackie Lee French. This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife. What do you mean, kissing her like that? - I ought to slap your face. - Well, why don't you just kiss my ass? I never come to referee no fight. Well, good then. Come dance with me. Get yourself a drink, honey. I'll be back. Hi, Ruth. Wait for me outside. - A thousand barrels of oil a day. It's too hot in here. Let's go outside. I don't want drunks tromping on my feet. I have something for you anyway. - Hey, Sonny. - Hey. Hi. Hi, Sonny. Hi, Dad. How you doing? Okay. That's good. See you. Sure. You mean my Christmas present. I haven't had time to get you anything yet. I had no time to shop. Hope you like it. I saved for six months. Oh, it's just beautiful. It's just what I've been wanting. You're so sweet, spending all that money on me. You're so sexy, Duane. I wish I didn't have to leave you tonight. Well, you don't. I do too. I could just kill my mother. She made me promise to go to a swim party in Wichita with Lester Marlow. - His folks are rich. Don't be mad. - I ain't mad, but goddamn it! It's all Lester's fault. He keeps asking Mama. - I want to stay with the man I love. - Goddamn... No, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go. Why you asking my girl out? - Turn me loose! - When you're ready to fight. Let's have it out! Here, knock off that shit, boys. This is the Christmas season. Run along, Wichita. I can't stand here all night protecting your shoeshine. I don't know what to do about him. He's so crazy about me. Nothing against Duane, but that's a roughneck for you. They aren't sophisticated about these things. Well, merry Christmas. Come in and let's have some punch, boys. Hi, Sonny. Oh, hi. Want to help me? Okay. You're not dancing. Don't you have a girlfriend? I did. We broke up a couple of months ago. Oh? Why? Mind my asking? I was going with Charlene Duggs. She thought I got fresh with her. I never did, really. We broke up because we didn't like each other much to begin with. I hope you're not sad about it. I don't think Charlene's near nice enough for you. I didn't see you dancing. No, I don't dance much. Will you drive me to the clinic again next week? Oh, you bet. We better not dawdle here. Bobby. Hey, look! New victims! Hi, Jacy. Glad you made it. We're dressed informally, as you can see. You know Annie-Annie. You want to join the club? Sure. You gotta get undressed out there on the diving board. So everybody gets to watch. - We all did the first time. - That's the rule. Yeah, I did it last Easter. Okay? Okay. Everybody out for the strip show! Look out. Don't pay attention to Sandy. He's my brother. If he gooses you, I'll make him go to bed. Goodness. I hope I don't fall off this thing. Sandy can fish you out if you do. Duane, been looking for you. Where's Jacy? Don't remind him. We just got him quiet. Want a drink? - Where'd you get it? - In a guy's car. - He weren't looking. - Let's do something. Why don't we hunt up some pussy? You wouldn't know what to do with it if we found some. What happened? Lester took his girl to a swimming party. Let's all go out and get a fuck. I know where's a heifer. It belongs to my Uncle Hank. Why the hell not? - A heifer beats nothing. - Pussy's pussy. I don't want no heifer. - We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass. - We oughtn't let him die a virgin. Mama says idiot kids don't live long. He ain't no idiot. He just don't talk. Bet he's still a virgin. Hey, we ought to fix him up with Jimmie Sue. - It'd make no difference to Billy. - We shouldn't try anything like that. Why not? It wouldn't cost us more than $1.50. If that's all, we should get her ourselves. Shit! A heifer's better than Jimmie Sue. Get the stupid thing in here. I ain't got all night. Come on, let's get those pants off, boys. - You won't be a virgin much longer. - We're gonna get you laid. Grab on now. Come on, do your job. Get her, Billy-boy! This is the dumbest thing! He don't even know what to do! It worked for me. Put it to her, boy! - Get her, Billy. - Come on, screw it to her, boy. Stop that yelling out there. It ain't even in! Goddamn... Goddamn, you stupid little thing! Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess! You okay, Billy? You all right? Well, now I know. Idiots as bad as Mexicans. Don't bother me no more for that crazy thing. Wouldn't mess with him again for less than three and a half. Which one of you bloodied his nose? I told you not to fight with Billy. He don't understand about fighting. What happened? - It weren't none of us, Sam. - No, it was Jimmie Sue. Jimmie Sue? How'd he get messed up with her? We bought him a piece of ass. Thought he was tired of being a virgin. She got mad about something and bloodied his nose. You boys get on out of here. I don't want to have no more to do with you. Scaring a poor, unfortunate creature like Billy... ...just so you could have a few laughs. I've been around that trashy behaviour all my life. I'm getting tired of putting up with it. You can stay out of this pool hall, my caf?... ...and my picture show too. I don't want no more of your business. We didn't mean for anything bad to happen, Sam. We... You didn't even have the decency to wash his face. We're his best customers. He can't run us off. Can he? Lucky I fell asleep. I'd hate not being able to shoot no pool. You sure he won't come? You know he won't. He's starting basketball practice. It's all right. I'm sorry I cried. Just scared, I guess. He ain't gonna come. They're probably running plays right now. No, not scared of that. Scared I could never do this, I guess. Can't seem to do anything without crying about it. How could you like me? I like you. I'm glad. Come on in. I ain't gonna throw bottles at you. What've you been doing? You lost weight. Ain't had any of your cheeseburgers in weeks. Come on. I'll fix you one. Even though that wasn't a nice thing y'all done to Billy. You can't blame Sam. - Was that your idea? - No. - Duane's? - Huh? He was there, wasn't he? He didn't have the decency to own up to it. Don't worry, I won't tell on him. I should, though. Sure smells good. One thing I know for sure. You can't sneeze here without somebody offering a handkerchief. - What you mean? - Nothing. It's an awful small town for any kind of carrying on. Don't forget to put onions on. And some people got a lot of guns. All right, you don't need my advice anyway. Why don't you go play a record? These'll be done in a minute. Just come in to say hello to Genevieve. Sonny. Food's getting cold. What you grinning about? Chicken-fry me a steak. Try to use meat this time. I heard about the ball game last night. 121 to 14. Must be pretty near a record. Sam. I'm sorry. I reckon y'all need glasses. Now, hold still. Want some more cookies? - More milk? - I'm full. How come you've stayed with the coach? You don't like him much. I wasn't brought up to leave a husband. I guess that's why. Maybe I was just scared to. I never noticed how ugly this room is. What's your favourite colour? I don't know. Blue. - Maybe I'll repaper it. - Why'd you marry him? I don't know. My mother didn't like him. Maybe that was it. Well, I was 20 years old. I thought hairy-chested football coaches were about it. I'm gonna buy us a new quilt. A blue one. What you think he'd do if he found us? Shoot us, probably. He's always glad to have an excuse to use his deer rifle. I thought you boys wanted to fish. Keep an eye on them corks, Billy. I don't think there's anything here except turtles. That's what I like about it, tell you the truth. - Want to try one? - Sure. I never liked to clean fish or eat them either. You spend half your time picking out bone. I just come out here to get a little scenery. Too pretty a day to spend in town. You wouldn't believe how this country's changed. First time I seen it, there wasn't a mesquite tree on it. Or a prickly pear neither. I used to own this land, you know. First time I watered a horse at this tank... ...was more than 40 years ago. I reckon the reason I drag you out here is... ...l'm as sentimental as the next fellow when it comes to old times. Old times. I brought a young lady swimming out here once... ...more than 20 years ago. It was after my wife had lost her mind. And my boys was dead. Me and this young lady was pretty wild, I guess. In pretty deep. We used to come here on horseback and swim without no bathing suits. One day she wanted to swim the horses across this tank. Kind of a crazy thing to do, but we done it anyway. She bet me a silver dollar she could beat me across. She did. This old horse I was riding didn't want to take the water. But she was always looking for something to do like that. Something wild. I bet she's still got that silver dollar. Whatever happened to her? She growed up. She was just a girl then, really. Let me help you with that. Why didn't you ever marry her after your wife died? She was already married. Her and her husband was young and miserable with one another... ...like so many young married folks are. I thought they'd change with some age... ...but it didn't turn out that way. - Is being married always so miserable? - Not really. About 80 percent of the time, I guess. We ought to go to a real fishing tank next year. It don't do to think about things like that too much. If she was here, I'd probably be just as crazy now... ...as I was then in about five minutes. Ain't that ridiculous? No, it ain't really. Being crazy about a woman like her is always the right thing to do. Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous. Getting old. I'm glad I wasn't on fire. I'd have burned to death before you got one button undone. I'm going to get a drink of water. I wondered where you went. Annie-Annie asleep? Yeah. Nice. You a virgin? Guess I am. Too bad. - I don't want to be, though. - I don't blame you. Come see me when you're not. Why don't we just go someplace? I'm sick and tired of this town. - You're my only friend. - Go and stay gone? Except Jacy. No, I don't know. Hey, we go to Mexico. Be back sometime Monday. - Would the pickup make it? - Yeah. How much money you got? Thirty bucks, about. Well, I got 40. We can make it on that. Come on! You guys want... - Where you going? - Mexico. Where? Better come with us, Sam. We're headed for the valley. - Where did you say? - Mexico. - It's about the wildest. - All the way down. You going all the way to Mexico tonight in this old heap of junk? My God! Reckon the town will get along without us till Monday? I reckon. If I was young enough, I'd go with you. - Need any money? - No, we got plenty. Well, you'd better take some for some insurance. Take money below that border, it sort of melts sometimes. Thanks, Sam. Try not to drink too much of that buggy water. We'll just drink beer and tequila. You catch the clap, you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothing. Oh, well. We'll see you. - Thank you. - So long. Hey, wake up! We're back. My stomach don't feel so good. Got any more Tums? You ate them all before we got to San Antonio. Genevieve will have something. My stomach don't feel so good. Closed. Closed? I ain't never seen her closed before. No, not even for Christmas. Maybe Sam will have something. I'm sick. Well, it ain't that early. Must be some kind of holiday. Sam don't close on holidays. Maybe he had to go someplace. Let's go ask Andy. - Somebody will steal the town. - Where is everybody? - Asleep. Everybody that's got sense. - Why'd Sam close the caf?? Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you? Gone to Mexico. - You don't know about it. - What? Sam died yesterday morning. Died? Yep. Quite a blow. Keeled over one of the snooker tables, had a stroke. Sam the Lion? Yep. Sam's dead. He was quite a fellow. He had his own way of doing things, that's for sure. They found his will. Craziest thing you ever heard. He left you the pool hall, Sonny. What do you think about that? He left Genevieve the caf?. That's the only thing he done that made any sense. Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey. Hell, she's too far gone to even run a popcorn machine. And the craziest thing of all... ...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton, the preacher's boy. Beats all I ever heard of. He could just as easily left that to me. I deserve it at least as much as that ignorant little bastard. Anyhow, it's done. They're burying him tomorrow. Come in. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh, Duane, hurry. What's wrong, honey? I don't know. That tickles. I can't stand to be tickled. What's the matter? Aren't you gonna do it? I don't know what's wrong. How could anything be wrong? Just go on and do it. What's the matter with you? I don't know, something's happened. Get off a minute! You might fall and mash me. I don't know what happened. It was Mexico. No telling what you got down there. I hate you! I don't know why I dated you. I don't know what happened. Put your clothes on. You think I want to look at you naked? I knew you couldn't do it. I'll always be a virgin! What do we say? The whole class knows. I want to cry. You're the meanest boy ever. My mother was dead-right about you. I don't know what happened. Don't go out there! We haven't had time to do it. I don't want anyone to know. You better not tell. You just pretend it was wonderful! I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. If you say that again, I'll bite you! Tell us about it. What was it like? I just can't describe it. I just can't describe it in words. I can do it now. I know I can. Quit prissing! I don't think you did it right anyway. Come on. It's your graduation present. Hope you like it. I never seen one as nice. - Hello? - Jacy? What's on your feeble mind? Same as been. I want a date. Why don't you just go back to Mexico? I guess girls are easier to please there. Just go with me one more time. You can at least see me. Pester someone else. I got a new boyfriend. - I can't be talking to you. - Who? Bobby Sheen, of course. - You crazy? - I certainly am not. I guess I wanted to go with him all along and never realized it. Maybe we'll see you in Wichita sometime. Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell! I hate to see you go. I don't got a goddamn thing to stay for. Roughnecks say you can get a job in Odessa anytime. Come on back if you don't. You hear they busted up, let me know. Why don't we watch the movie? Hi, I didn't hear you. Gene home? No, he and Mama went to the club. What are you doing home on a Saturday night? Bobby Sheen ran off and got married. Annie-Annie Martin. Want me to turn the TV off? No, I'm gonna go play pool. Tell your dad the well came in okay. I wish I could go to the pool hall. I've always wanted to. It's terrible, the things girls aren't allowed to do. Well, hell, come on. I'll show you the pool hall. Aren't people there? If there are, they'll be in back asleep now. Won't bother us. I got my own key. Okay, I will then. Goodness, it sure is dark in here. What a night. I never thought something like this would happen. How about hopping out? He's just awful! Why do you fool with him? - Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he? - He sure is. Your daddy's a very nice man. I ought to give Abilene hell instead of him. Bobby was the last one. I'm just gonna be an old maid. That's just the way it goes. You win a few, you lose a few. What do you do? Nothing's ever the way it's supposed to be. You're right. Come on. I want to tell you something. What I've done hasn't worked out well. I think maybe we better think of something else for you. I guess Ruth Popper's got about as good a setup as anyone. Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably good-looking and he's young. Don't you know? It's been going on about six months. - I thought you kids knew everything. - That's silly! She's 40 years old. So am I, honey. It's kind of an itchy age. Want an orange? I don't believe it. Sonny's always wanted to go with me. Pretty easy shot, sheriff. Sheriff, we got trouble. Goddamn you, Monroe! You made me scratch. Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's little girl's been kidnapped. The preacher's boy put her in his car two hours ago. What the hell? Maybe Joe Bob just give her a ride home. Be doing her a favour in this hot weather. Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg? I just know she's not home. They was seen headed toward Olney. Mrs. Clarg's afraid that Joe Bob might be... Gonna molest her or something. You and these boys come with us. If that's the way it is, no telling what we'll find. Molly! Get him! Ain't you going to? Here's my little girl. He's the one that done it. Why don't you get him? If my husband was here, he'd kill him dead. What'd you do to that child? We know you done something. Come on. Filthy! Here now, grab her. None of this goddamn frenzy. It's the Lord's justice, son. You'll suffer with the murderer and the thief. Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town. We gotta get this man to jail. - Doctor said he did nothing. - Never had the guts. - Preacher's boy. - Sheriff figured he done something. Isn't it terrible, Sonny? Did you see anything? Nothing to see except Mrs. Clarg. If she had a gun, she might've killed us all. Joe Bob didn't do nothing. He must've done something. It scares me to death. You never can tell when something terrible is gonna happen. It's okay. They got him now. I called you before. You did? I felt lonesome. Thought you might want to drive around. Well, I'm supposed to be someplace. I'm still a little scared. Please take me riding. Where will we drive? Ever hear from Duane? Got a postcard. I really feel sad about that. He makes 320 a month. Said he bought a car. I'll always be a little in love with Duane. We had too much against us. It wasn't easy being the one to break up. - Sonny? - What? Not here. I'm too old for screwing in cars. I don't like to hurry. Why don't we go to Wichita and get a motel room? I'm afraid to. My folks are watching me. They know I don't want to go to college. They might think we'll run off and get married. We'll do it when it's safe. We got all summer. - Hey, Duane. - Hey, buddy! You turned roughneck. Had to so I could keep the pool hall open. - When did you get in? - About 2:00. I thought I'd surprise you. Is this yours? How about that? 38,000 miles and she runs like new. - Do you want a beer? - Not me. That's all I eat for breakfast anymore. Hey, sure is a nice car. I like to drive it so much, I thought I'd drop home for the weekend. You can't take too good care of a car like this. I wash her every week. It looks great. Hear about Joe Bob? I always knew he was crazy. He didn't do nothing, except get her to take her underpants off. He's out of jail now. You still screwing that old lady? No. Yeah. I've been kind of busy. I seen old Leroy last week. He thought you and Jacy been going together. Yeah, we have, a little. She's been bored, so sometimes we go eat Mexican food. I hear that ain't all you been eating. Whoever told you that don't know what he's talking about. I been going with her. Why not? I never said I blamed you for it. I don't much. I never thought you'd do that. We was friends. We are. What you so mad for? I never done nothing to you. - Screwing my girl ain't nothing? - I ain't. - Hell, you ain't! - Well, I ain't. - She's not your girl. - She is! - You don't live here no more. - That makes no difference! I'm getting her back. She'll marry me someday. - She won't. - We're meant to get married. She's off to college soon. I doubt I'll get to go with her myself, once she gets off. I didn't think it could hurt to go with her this summer. - She'll never marry you. - Don't tell me she won't! She'd never let you screw her. I was just seeing how honest you was. Jacy'd never let you. You ain't that good a cocksman. You never even screwed Charlene all that time. Course I didn't! You know why? Because you had the pickup all the time Saturday night. I didn't have time to screw her. I could've done it in five minutes without a pickup. She only went with you because you was in the backfield... ...and I was in the line. - What are you saying? We was in love. You was. She likes me as much as she ever liked you. - That's a lie. - I'll stay with her all night too. - She promised. - You won't. Why shouldn't I? She told me you couldn't do it that time in Wichita Falls. What happened? This is your Turntable Matinee on KTRN... Now here's Hank Williams. There's a lady in the waiting room. She sent you this. Could you tell her I'm asleep? Please? All right. That too cold? No, it's great. Say, I hear Duane joined the Army. Good place for him too. He didn't mean to hit me with the bottle. That boy's always had meanness in him. Jacy's the kind of girl that brings out the meanness in a man. She's just like her grandmother. I hadn't ought to talk about them. We was all good friends once. Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow. He and Lois used to live in this one-room place... ...over the newspaper office. Lois couldn't afford a flour sack, much less a mink. I've always had a soft spot for her, though. I wondered a lot of times what would've happened... ...if my Dan had made the strikes that Gene made. They offered that rig to him first. Dan Morgan never took a chance in his life. Do you wish y'all had made it? Sure, I wish we'd made it. I guess the Army won't take me now I just got one good eye. You want to go to Korea and get killed? You ain't got your senses back yet, what few you ever had. The caf? won't run itself. You rest up now. Here's for the cheeseburger. I'll bring your change when I bring your supper. Come on in. I was so worried. I had to see you. I've been missing you. And I'm a lot better than I was. Here, sit down. You can't believe how famous we are. We're all anyone talks about. - Yeah, I guess so. - I want us to get married. - What? - I really do. - Get married? - Just as soon as you want to. - Don't you want to? - Oh, yeah. The town will be knocked for a loop. They'll never forget it. Ain't you going to college? I don't care about that. I love you. That's more important. You were so dear to fight for me. My folks won't like it but we'll run off. - They'll kill us. - No, they won't. - They'll kill me. - They'll get over it. You work for Daddy now anyway. Pretty soon, they'll love you just as much as I do. Can we? Sure, I just hope I can see to drive. Don't you worry. I can drive. Don't do that, Sonny. Why not? We're man and wife. We can do anything. Not while I'm driving. I might have a wreck. Wouldn't it be awful if Mama and Daddy got the police after us? - They don't even know where we are. - I had to leave them a note. - So they wouldn't worry. - You shouldn't have done that. I figured they'd have to know sometime. Well, what could they get us for? We got a right to get married. Ain't we? I guess so. I wish you didn't have that stupid eye patch. It's really creepy. I can take it off pretty soon. About two hours will be Lake Texoma. Have a room to ourself. My goodness. You're sitting so close, I can barely drive. Oh, goodness. Howdy. - What part of Texas y'all from? - Anarene. Newlyweds, ain't you? Y'all better follow me in. Somebody's looking for you. We got a right to get married. How can you arrest us? I ain't arresting you. I just want you to come with me. - I don't know what your rights are. - I guess we better follow him. I'll just be heartbroken if my folks have done this. You think I worked hard so Jacy'd end up in a pool hall? - We was gonna get an apartment. - I'll bet! Where are your car keys, hon? It's a hell of a note! - Shut up and take her home. - You bet I will! You take her car. As far as I'm concerned, he can walk! Not much of a wedding night, huh? Not much of one. Here. Have a little drink of bourbon. It'll pick you up. Take all of it. I'm gonna drive. You won't believe this... ...but you're lucky we got you clear of her quick as we did. You'd have been better off staying with Ruth Popper. Does everybody know about that? Of course. Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo. Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head. Well, she's prettier. I guess I shouldn't have, though. I guess I treated her terrible. Guess you did. Sure weren't out of Texas very long. Oklahoma's not much of an improvement. It's not the same now. Nothing's really been right since Sam the Lion died. No, it hasn't. Oh, God. I get sad if I think of Sam for long. Did you know he had beautiful hands? I guess you liked him, didn't you? I guess everybody did. Well, I'll tell you, it was different with me. I loved him. He loved me too. Are you the one he used to take swimming out at the tank? He told you about that, huh? Yeah, I was the one. I guess if it wasn't for Sam... ...l'd just about have missed it. Whatever it is. I'd have been one of them amity types that thinks... ...that playing bridge is the best thing that life has to offer. Old Sam the Lion. Nobody knows where he got that name. I gave it to him. One night... ...it just came to me. He was so pleased. I was 22 years old then. Can you imagine? It's terrible... ...to only meet one man in life who knows what you're worth. Just terrible. I've looked too. You wouldn't believe how I've looked. Well, now I know. That's why Sam liked you. Loved me. Loved you, I mean. Do you? I can kind of see what he saw in you too. Nope. I'll just go on home. Go on. Get out. Think I could learn to drink? You might. Better keep on practising. That Logan boy's a quarterback, ain't he? Boy, we've finally got us a team! Didn't back in your day, did they? No, we wasn't much good. You just never learned the fundamentals. You know, blocking and tackling. Not like this team. - When was it you graduated? - Last year. You don't mean it. Seems longer than that since you and Duane played ball. I seen Duane a while ago. He's home on leave, wearing his uniform. I ain't seen him yet. - How are you, Chester? - Fine, coach. See if we can't stretch that goddamn thing a little. You know a man never ought to cheat, unless it's for a good cause. He's a good old boy, ain't he? Hi, Mrs. Jackson. Duane here? That's his car out there, ain't it? He's here if he ain't walked off. Hi, how you been? Pretty good. I been thinking all week that I'd run into you. I heard you was going to Korea. Thought I'd get over and see you before you got off. Glad you did. I'm taking the bus in the morning. Want to go to the picture show? Miss Mosey has to close it. - Tonight's the last night. - Yeah, might as well go. Hate to miss the last night. Take the Mercury. Be my last chance to drive it for a while. - Ready, Matthew? - All ready. Take them to Missouri, Matt. That was a good movie. Seen it here before once. Let's run over to Wichita and drink some beer. Okay. I got lots of time till morning. Sure. - So long. - Sorry you're closing the show. Nobody wants to come to shows no more. Kid baseball in the summer, television all the time. Sam had lived, I believe we could've kept it going. But I just didn't have the know-how. Won't be much to do in town with the picture show closed. Well, so long. Duane. You watch out now, overseas. Sure weren't no women around. I guess the next piece of ass I get will be yellow. I wish I was going with you. Take care of the car for me. Your ma don't need it? I wouldn't want her driving it, the way she drives. You might help her take the groceries home sometimes. You ever... You ever hear from Jacy? No, not a thing. She don't get home much. Ain't been back to town since August. I guess she always stays in Dallas. Yeah, probably does. I guess there's lots to do there. I ain't over her yet, you know. No, I ain't over her yet. It's the damnedest thing. That's the only reason you and I got into it that time, you know. Reckon she likes Dallas? Hard to say. Maybe she does. Reckon you and her would've got it straighted out if I hadn't butted in? No, they'd have annulled me too, even if we had. Y'all never even got into the motel? Better get on before we both freeze. Here are the keys. - So long, buddy. - So long, Duane. Be careful. I'll take care of your car. See you in a year or two if I don't get shot. The trucker didn't have a chance. I could see it wasn't his fault. The sand was blowing. I never noticed him. Figured nobody'd be in the street. What was he doing out there anyway? He weren't doing nothing. He's just simple-minded. - Never had sense. - Wasn't your fault. Hell, no. I can see that. He was just a dumb old kid. Didn't know enough to keep his ass out of the cold. Let's eat. Ain't had breakfast. I'd like to know what he was doing with that broom. He was sweeping, you sons of bitches! He was sweeping! Y'all got some crazy kids in this town. Could I have a cup of coffee with you? I guess. I'm sorry. I'm still in my bathrobe. What am I doing apologising to you? Why am I always apologising to you, you little bastard?! Three months I've apologised to you without you even here! I haven't done anything wrong. Why can't I quit apologising?! You ought to be sorry! I wouldn't be in my bathrobe if not for you. I'd have my clothes on. You're the one made me quit caring if I got dressed or not! Just because your friend got killed... ...you want me to forget what you did and make it all right? I'm not sorry for you. You'd have left Billy, just like you left me. I bet you left him plenty of nights... ...whenever Jacy whistled. I wouldn't treat a dog that way. You thought I was so old and ugly you didn't owe me any explanation. You didn't need to be careful. There was nothing I could do, so why be careful? You didn't love me. Look at me. Can't you even look at me? See? Shouldn't have come here. I'm around that corner now. You've ruined it. It's lost completely. Just your needing me won't make it come back. Never you mind, honey. Never you mind. Subtitles by SDI Media Group",https://subslikescript.com/movie/The_Last_Picture_Show-67328
Fantastic Four (2005) - full transcript,"A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom.","Typical of Victor Von Doom to build a 30-foot statue of himself. Well, it's obviously aimed at first-time visitors... to create feelings of smallness, inadequacy. Good thing it ain't working. Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science. This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot. Besides, Victor's not that bad. He's just a little larger than life. My research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm... borne on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life. In six weeks, another cloud with the same elemental profile... will pass Earth's orbit. A study conducted in space could fundamentally advance our knowledge... about the structure of the human genome, cure countless diseases... extend human life, give kids a chance to live longer, stronger, healthier... Turn it off, please. I don't think I have explained my proposal fully. No, I think you have. Same old Reed, always stretching, reaching for the stars... with the weight of the world on his back. But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? You remember, when we were in school we talked about working together. Well, that's what I was about to explain. The storm is deadly. But the shields on your station's control room... are designed to protect any occupants inside. So it's not just my money you want. It's my toys. Tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you, then why should I? That's my job, to stay a step ahead. To know what other men don't. I can't take this. Ben, this is business, just work. He's right, Ben. It is just business. I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm. One more thing he's got. - Hey, Susie. - Hey. It's so nice to see you. How's Debbie? - Great. - Great. - How have you been? - Never better. This isn't going to be a problem, is it? - No. - Not at all. Good. Then you're just in time to hear the great Reed Richards... ask me for help. You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair. So you'll excuse me if I savour the moment. You back this mission and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any application... The number's 75%. And its applications and patents. - What about his first-born? - Ben... Come on. 25% of a billion is enough to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it? Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building. Deal? Well, then. To our future. Together! It's funny how things turn out, isn't it? Hilarious. He knew about NASA. Maybe he made the call to shut us down. Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works. Look, we got what we wanted. That's enough. A few days in space, it'll be great. What's the worst that can happen? If Reed's right, this little trip could double our stock offerings. - And if he's not... - Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got. Reed, you should know those solar winds have been picking up speed. I factored them into my coordinates. Right, of course you did. In theory. It's a little different once you're out there. - I can assure you I... - When are we leaving? I'll be scheduling the launch... so you can call me in the morning for resources and crew. - I think I remember the number. - It's been changed. As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission. We already have a pilot on our payroll, but you're welcome to ride shotgun. Remember my brother, Johnny? Can't do it. Cannot do it. External SRBs, orbital system engines, it's just like the shuttle you flew. No! I cannot take orders from the underwear model. - Come on now, Ben. - That wingnut washed out of NASA... for sneaking two Victoria's Secret wannabes into a flight simulator. Youthful high spirits. They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator. When have I ever asked you to do something... you absolutely said you could not do? Five times. - I had it at four. - Well, this makes five. Attention, all personnel. Commencing launch sequence in six hours. I miss you already, Debs. Captain on the bridge! Digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59. The look on your hard-ass former CO's face... when he finds out he's your junior officer: Priceless. Thank you. That's so sweet. I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition. But I don't know whether I should be flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits. - I mean, who the hell came up with these? - Victor did. The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your body's individual needs. See, now that means it keeps the hot stuff hot... and it keeps the cool stuff cool. Wow. Fantastic. Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this. Great minds think alike. - Here you go, Ben. - Thanks, sweetie. Reed. ETA until cosmic event: Nine hours. If you're good, maybe next time Daddy'll let you drive. You keep talking and there won't be a next time. Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. Is it safe? The shields on the station should protect us. Should? What's the matter, Ben? Getting paranoid in your old age? Let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben. So I see you're still doing all the heavy lifting. Maybe you should have stayed in the lab. Fieldwork never suited you. He does the talking, I do the walking. Got it? So take a walk, Ben. Actually, if you'll all excuse me, I need to borrow Susan for a moment. Sure. Please tell me your guy's not trying to rekindle things with my sister again. Of course not. It's strictly business. Yes, well, his eyes say differently, don't they? Two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it, either. Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep. Let's think about that. You got Victor, more money than God, stud of the year. And you got Reed, world's dumbest smart guy, worth less than a postage stamp. That's a real toss-up. Don't trouble your tiny little mind. Don't wander off now, boy. Securing airlock chamber. Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal? I understand the business reasons. Well, when you're looking at your future... it doesn't hurt to find closure about the past. Susan, every man dreams he'll meet a woman he can give the world to. In my case, it's not just a metaphor. Opening viewing station shield. That can't be right. Event threshold in T-minus 9 minutes, 47 seconds. That's impossible. It should be seven hours. We've been together two years now. It's been a good two years, Victor. The company's accomplished so much. Right, of course, the company. But, you see, I've come to realise that all the accomplishments in the world... mean nothing without someone to share them with. I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. Now it's time to take the biggest step of all. - Victor. - If it helps, think of this as a promotion. - Victor, I... - I have four words. Four little words that can change our lives forever. The cloud is accelerating. We've got minutes until it hits, not hours. Victor, that storm is deadly. We need to abort. Get a grip, Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first glitch. Just close the shields. - Ben is still out there. - So reel him in. But we came here to do a job, so let's do it quickly. Victor, Reed's right. We have less than six minutes! - Ben, you need to get inside now. - What's going on? I ain't done arranging your flowers yet, egghead. Ben, turn around! Guys, I'm not gonna make it. Ben, you gotta jump. It's the only way! - What are you doing? - Closing the shields. - You can't just leave them out there. - Watch me. - You can't help them any more than I can. - I can try. Come on, Ben, you got it! Okay, Johnny, get ready to close the portal. Wake up. Ben. Rise and shine, big boy. How you feeling? Where am I? Back on Earth. We're in quarantine. Victor's medical facility. Reed? Sue? They're fine. Everybody else is fine. What's wrong with me? I swear to you, Ben. They've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world are here, Ben. You had the best. - Give me that mirror. - I don't know if that's a good idea. - They said the shock alone... - I said give me that goddamn mirror! Okay, Ben, just be strong. Unfortunately, the doctors just couldn't do anything to fix your face. - Hi. - Hey. Nice do. I'm liking the grandpa look. What? - How's she doing? - Stable and her vitals are strong. Blood panels show no irradiation. Good. - You'll step up this protocol every... - Every four hours, yes. We know what we're doing. Another day of observation and you're all clear. Excuse me. More flowers from Mr. Von Doom. She's allergic to orchids. Put the sunflowers by her bed, they're her favourites. Well, Victor... the bank would like to congratulate you... on the fastest freefall since the Depression. We can't even give your stock away. Ned, you know I can turn this around. Well, you're going to have to, Victor, or we pull out. You have a week. You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned? One week. Where do we think we're going? I don't know if we've noticed... but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window. Yeah, I've noticed, but there are rules here. - You can't leave until we... - Until we've finish the tests. I know, I've never been good with rules. You let me know how those come out. - Do you wanna help me with this zipper? - You know, this is not a ski resort. Not yet. Luckily, Grandma still sends care packages, though. You know, it's amazing, for an 80-year-old woman, you'd be surprised... - You are trouble. - Trouble is my middle name. You're hot! Why, thank you. So are you. And I'm not afraid to cry. No, I mean, you feel a little feverish. Well, I've never felt better in my life. My God, you smell good. Listen, when do you get off work? - 4:00, but I... - Tell you what. You meet me at 4:01 at the top of the mountain. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. This is yours, that's mine. Nurses! How long was I out? Hey. Three days. Man, I was worried about you. - How are you feeling? - Solid. - That was a close one, though, huh? - Yeah. - What was that about? - I don't know. I really don't know. I've been going over the figures again and again and they all add up. I just don't understand. Maybe I should have aborted... Reed, it was a freak of nature. You couldn't have possibly predicted it. Let it go. You know, you live through something like this... it really makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. - Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect. - I'm not talking about Debbie. What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor. He's smart, he's powerful, he's successful... Well, maybe you should date him then. Ben, she ended up with the right guy. Things worked out for the best. Do I have to do everything myself? All right. I think you should stay to the right. The left might give you trouble. - I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet. - Good. Last one down springs for room service! That's my future wife. You're losing! All right, no more kid's stuff. Check this out. You're on fire. Thanks! You're pretty good, too. No, you're on fire. Look! Care to join me? I can only stay for one drink 'cause I have to meet Victor. Well, wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting. Reed, what are you doing here? I thought... Great! Maybe you can join us. How's the IPO now? It's falling. We're looking at low 20s. It's a good number considering the fallout from... From Reed's disaster? Get me on the a.m. Shows, Larry King, the cover of the Journal. I have to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot me from my left side. Actually, the scar's tracking well. People seem to think it humanises you. And that's a good thing? You know, maybe you should get some rest. Later. First, I have some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing. Sir, I have always wondered, why Sue? You could have any other woman in the world. That's why. Because I could have any other woman. - No, let me tell the story. - No, let him tell the story. - You all right? - Yeah, bad shrimp. I think I better go lie down. Excuse me. Oh, God! So, you feeling better? Yes, thank you. Good. That's... good. You always had a way with words. Wow. I should be going because... I have to meet Victor. I'm really happy for you and Victor. You're really happy for me and Victor? I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship. - Which was? - Passion... for science. You're such a dork, Reed. You never got it... - and you never will... - Well, what did I say? ...unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. I just wanted to let you know that I... It's been two years, and all you can say is that you're happy... for me and some other guy? Victor may be a lot of things. But at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants. It's nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed. To be seen and heard. Look at me. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Look at me! Sue, look at your hands! Hey, you guys. You are never gonna believe what just happened to me. What? Well, I can explain this. It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA. Let's not jump to conclusions. We need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap. Guys, look! Now, picture that, but everywhere. It was everywhere. What? The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA. - Cool! - We need to find Ben. And you know what, guys? I think I was flying. I said, cut it out, Johnny. I'm getting the hang of it. - Ben, it's Reed. - Stop. - All right. - All right? - Yes. - God! - God? - What's wrong with you? - What? - Sue, do you know the code? I might. Ben, open up. You all right, Ben? Does somebody have keys to these doors? Anybody? Just break the glass. It can't be that thick. Give me another couple of seconds, guys. I almost got it. That's gross. Ben? Look. What is that thing? What's going on? What happened in here? Victor, are you feeling all right? I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all. Ben did this. He's had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud. We all have different symptoms. Symptoms? - Victor, I should have... - Just find him. Anybody got any ideas where the big guy's going? He's going home. You gotta be kidding me. Little buttons. Hello, Operator? - Hello? - Debs? - It's me. - Ben? Are you all right? You sound a little different. - Listen, I need you to come out front. - Out front? You're home, baby? Yeah. I got a surprise for you. Yeah, I got a little one for you, too. Ben? Where are you? I'm over here. Don't come any closer for a sec, okay? It's gonna be a bit of a shock. Honey, what's going on? Debs... remember when we used to say... together forever no matter what? Yeah. Well... Baby, you're scaring me. Oh, my God. Deb, it's me. It's still me. It was the accident. Let me explain. - No! Don't touch me! - Debs! I'm calling the police. Everybody all right? I saw him. It's that guy over there! Okay, so he was there last night. Debbie's gonna meet us on the other side of the bridge. Yeah, Ben. ""A few days in space. It'll be great. ""What's the worst that could happen?"" Hey, little guy. You're not afraid of me, are you? Perfect. Thanks. Hey! You think you've got problems? You take a good look, pal. How bad could it be, right? I don't think you... Okay, pal. Take it easy. No, don't go out there. Look, I said stop, you fruitcake! No. Come close. That's further. Come closer. I said, stop! No! Come here. All right, calm down. You wanna be scared? - Fine! - No! Get back, everybody! Get back in your vehicle. We'll tell you when you can go. - What do we do now? - We're not going to get past these guys. But you could. Sorry about the truck, pal. Come on. A little help, here? You wanna hit the button, sir? It's stuck. Sue, your clothes. Lose them. Right. This is so wrong. - Wow, you've been working out. - Shut up! All right. All right, freeze! Now just... Just put the man in the seat down. Do it! Any more great ideas? Why don't you strip down and have a 100 people stare at you? - Sue. - What? I'm gonna need therapy. Come on, let's get out of here. Excuse me. Coming through. All right, now just back away from him. And I want you to put your hands on your head... 954 approaching scene. I still can't believe you made me do that. We got through, didn't we? Just find Ben. Ben! Mum. Stay here, okay? I'm coming. Hold on. Hang on! I got you. Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground now! Ben. I swear to you... I will do everything in my power... until there is not a breath left in me. You're going to be Ben again. I told you I felt fine. Where are your ears? There are some folks outside that want to talk to you. We're not going public with this. We're scientists, not celebrities. It's too late, son. Look. ... when a New York Fire Department ladder truck... See that? ... became part of the tragedy. But the rescue itself is not the story. One of the four stretched to an amazing length... That's what they're calling you. ""The Fantastic Four."" - Cool. - No, wait! Where are you going? I'm gonna go talk to them. No, we should think this through. That's great. Brainstorm. Get back here, right now. Johnny! Settle down. Do you believe this? Which one of you is the leader? That would be me. No, seriously. Okay, son. You're on. During our recent mission to the Von Doom space station... we were exposed to as yet unidentified radioactive energy. - What happened on the bridge? - How can you stretch? - Were you really on fire? - Is it true you can fly? Yeah, I'm working on it. It's actually really difficult. No, actually, we do not know much more than you do at this point. Sir, Larry King just cancelled. Apparently, there's a bigger story. Actually, here they come now. You had to see it to believe it, folks. - The man... ...named The Fantastic Four... We'll be going directly to our lab to diagnose our symptoms. Symptoms? Is this some kind of disease? No. It's not a disease. If having special powers is a disease, then, yeah, we got it bad. Excuse me, that thing doesn't look so fantastic. Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero. What he means is, every team needs a mascot. A new day is dawning. The day of The Fantastic Four. Look! We went up to space to find a way to understand DNA... cure disease, save lives. Well, now it's our DNA, our disease, our lives on the line. Thank you. No more questions. This is how you turn things around? These freaks on the front page? Your company's in the obituaries? I was planning to use the publicity. The board's in agreement, the bank's lost enough already. - Wait a minute. - It's too late, Victor. Do you know how much money I've invested in this company? Victor, stop. This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification. We're pulling out. Is all that for you, Dr. Richards? I'm afraid so. Come on, Ben, smile. They want to like you, Ben. Say hi. Don't do drugs. Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards. I've got the usual for you. Good to have you back, sir. Thanks, Willie. We had a tough year. Yeah, like nine straight. Either we're moving really fast or not at all. I'll take the stairs. How come Ben can't turn it on and off like we can? That's what we're here to find out. I mean, if it happened to him... What? You mean, like, we won't be able to turn it off, either? That would save time. You don't really wanna walk around on fire for the rest of your life, do you? - Is that a trick question? - Grow up. Come on. Am I the only guy who thinks this is cool? We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... and figure out how to reverse them. But I have to warn you, it's gonna be a little crowded in some areas. So, what do you think? I don't know, Reed, I think you might be bringing your work home with you. Come on. Let me show you guys where you'll be staying. Busy guy. Mr. Von Doom, would you like to comment on the recent failure of your IPO? What about the rumours of a takeover? God, I was so worried about you. Victor. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to call. Please. No apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the-clock care. Thank you. That's very generous of you. But I think I should stay here with my brother... until we get a handle on things. Susan, I think you should let my doctors have a look at you. Victor, what are you doing here? I'm starting to wonder the same thing. How much do you know about what happened to you? Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. Well, you let me know what I can do. We're all in this together now. Victor, wait. I just wanted to say I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned. Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people. With all due respect, we're both to blame. I told you to abort. Abort? I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line. I will not let you make me look like a fool. Victor, if we can understand... I don't wanna understand it! This isn't one of your science projects! I just wanna fix it. Fast! Is there a problem? No. No problem, Ben. Just pay your damn electric bill and get to work on finding a cure. He's heating up from his core. And his vitals are completely normal. If we're going to identify the source of the mutation... we need to isolate your recombinant DNA... so we can activate positional genomes. We have to do a physical in order to see what got zapped. Why didn't you just say so? His internal organs are completely solid. How bad is it? You know, I used to smoke. It's not invisibility per se. You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people... if you could control your emotional state better. Excuse me? I'm saying, if you had a little more self-control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge? Anger. Rage. Frustration. Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or... I'm sure I can come up with something. - You feel anything? - Nope. Okay. It's hotter than I anticipated. - Okay, Johnny, back it down. - I can go hotter! Johnny, just back it down. - Johnny, back it down right now! - Johnny! Buzz kill! You guys are cramping my style. Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin. Any hotter and you're approaching supernova. - Sweet! - No, not sweet! That's the temperature of the sun. Not only could you kill yourself... but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere... and destroy all human life as we know it. Got it. Supernova: Bad. How's that coming? - I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, fine. - You sure? - Yeah. I... You probably thought that was some form of latent hostility. What in the world would give me that idea? I mean, you broke up with me, right? - Are you kidding? - No. I distinctly remember, you walked out my door, ergo... I was ready for the next step, you weren't. Ergo, I walked. I think it was a little bit more complicated than that. I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? - There were a lot of variables to consider. - No, there weren't. There was you and me. There were no variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But like always, Reed, your head got in the way. - No, it didn't. - Then what was it? Did you feel anything when I left? Do you feel anything right now? Hey, guys. I think we have a serious problem. So what's the prognosis? Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning somehow. And it's changing into? I don't really know. Some kind of organic-metallic alloy... stronger than titanium or carbon steel, harder than diamonds. Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long? At this rate, the infection could be complete in two, maybe three weeks. What do you mean complete? I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll have to notify the CDC. - What? - Centre for Disease Control. I know what it is. If this thing is contagious, we may have a big problem on our hands. We're talking about an epidemic here. Look at me. I have a life. I'm the face of a billion-dollar company. We need to keep this confidential. Victor, this disease is progressive, degenerative. I have to notify someone... That's terrible news. But I think I'll get a second opinion. Our uniforms were exposed to the storm, like us. So they can transform like us. Becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame. You guys look like an '80s rock band. You know, Ben, this material stretches. I'm sure I can figure out a way to make it fit. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing that. I love these costumes. They're missing something, though. Needs, like, spice. They're not costumes. You can't use your powers in public, Johnny. - You guys are worse than NASA. - You could burn somebody. Maybe it's missing a utility belt. Here you go, there's your change. Can I help you, buddy? - Oh, my. - It's Sue Storm, it's the Invisible Woman! Sue Storm, it is you. Listen, my kid loves you! I can't believe I'm doing this again. Reed, we really can't go outside anymore. We are on the cover of every publication from People... All right, I'm here, let's make this quick. I got a lot of places to go today. Oh, wait. I don't go anywhere. Johnny, it's imperative that we stay inside for the foreseeable future. I know, but when you said that last time, my brain heard ""a week."" Johnny, it's too dangerous for you to be in public. You've been saying that for years. What worries me is that our powers are evolving. I know! I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it. - You can't fly. - Yet. Johnny, can you put that napkin out? Jesus. So what's going on, Reed? How're you going to cure us? I'm going to build a machine to recreate the storm. The cosmic rays will travel from this generator to this chamber. What, no pop-ups? - If I can reverse the wave signal... - It'll return us back to normal. Right. But what are the risks? Even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially... or perhaps even kill us. Now, dying. That's bad, right? I say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys. So how long till this contraption's up and running? - I don't know, it's hard to say. - How long, Reed? - I don't know. - You don't know? - You don't want this to get worse. - Worse than that? Guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here for a while, so let's just try and get along. - You could knock! - Sorry! Johnny! More bad news for Von Doom Industries today as Ned Cecil announced... that his group of investors would seek to gain control... of Victor Von Doom 's numerous technology companies. Earlier, the IPO was pulled from the market... after the steady decline of its projected opening price. Von Doom Industries was never able to overcome the negative publicity... Interesting. Hello? Victor? What's with these lights, huh? About the IPO, no hard feelings, right? Nothing personal. You know, you could always move back to Latveria. Start fresh. Maybe that's where you belong, the old country. Nothing personal, Ned. But I'm not going anywhere. ... assassinated the competition everywhere this season. Truly unbelievable. The crowd is going nuts here at the arena. I tell you, if there's anybody out there who can do what these guys do... we dare you to come on down here. Look at this spread-eagle... no arm, back of the seat. Motorbike grab, landed... I got to get out of here. Hey, pretty boy, let's see what you got. Where's your hot sister and the monster? Let's go! All right. I want you all to make a lot of noise now for a very special guest. Mr. Johnny Storm from The Fantastic Four! Look at that lift! That was fantastic! But, Johnny, come on. That's old school. Show us something new. Something new. You got it. Come on, Johnny, come on! Is he flying? Wait, no! That's dangerous. I'm okay, I'm all right, I'm good. He's okay! He's all right! Johnny Storm, ladies and gentlemen! I have to give you props, Johnny! You were on fire! - He didn't. - Oh, yes, he did. - Flame Boy never listens. - What did he do to his uniform? Johnny, I've gotta ask you about this outfit. Yeah, it's sort of Armani meets astronaut. So what are your superhero names? They call me The Human Torch. Ladies call me Torch. What about the rest of the team? - That's the Invisible Girl. - Girl? What about your leader, Reed Richards? I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic. - Could've been worse. - I guess. Is it true what they say about him that he can expand any part of his anatomy? Well, I've always found him to be a little limp. What is that? What do you call that thing? That's it. The Thing. Yeah, you think this is bad, you should have seen him before. Okay. Now I'm gonna go kill him. There he is. - Johnny! - Can we talk about this later, guys? - No. We can't talk about this later. - We can do this at home. - What are you thinking? - Where's my ride? You think that's funny, Pebbles? - Johnny! - What? You gave us names? You don't think. So now you're the face of The Fantastic Four? A face that's about to be broken! Look, this isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again. What if I don't wanna be normal? I didn't turn into a monster! Ben! Did you just... Johnny, stop it. - That's it, Tinkerbell! - No, Ben. You wanna fly? Then fly! Wait a minute, guys! Ben, don't do this! Let's see if we can get blood from a stone. Let's see. Bring it, burnout! You two need a time-out! Talk to blockhead, he started it. I don't care. Damn it, Johnny. Ben, wait! What? You need to control yourself and think before you act. Yeah, but see, that's your problem. You always think, you never act. What if we got these powers for a reason? What if it's like some higher calling? A higher calling? Like getting girls and making money? Is there any higher? You know what, Reed? This is who we are. Accept it. Or better yet, enjoy it. Wait, Ben, slow down. He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead. It ain't him. It's them! I can't live like this. Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works. Analysing every little step before he takes one. - It's easy for you to be patient. - No, it's not! I thought I was done waiting for Reed, but I... - We're all in this together, Ben. - Together? Susie, look at me. You got no idea what I'd... What I'd give to be invisible. Thank you, gentlemen. I'm just gonna pick up a few things... for some friends. Perfect. That's not funny. This is Ben Grimm here. The first mook from Brooklyn to go into outer space. So pay him some respect. Just give me the usual and I'm out. All right. - Make it a double. - Make it a triple. - Put it on my tab, Ernie. - All right, Alicia. Appreciate it. No problem. It's okay, Ben. If there's a God, he hates me. She is not so into hate. If you could see me, you wouldn't be saying that. Then let me see you. Can I? - Careful. - It's okay. So sad. You know, being different isn't always a bad thing. Trust me. This ain't one of them times. Not if you don't want it to be. - All right, Ernie, I'm out of here. - I'll take you. See you later, Benny. I'm Alicia, by the way. Thanks, Ernie. Reed got what he wanted. And everything he wanted... he took from me. Now it's time to take it back. But first, I need to get rid of his bodyguard. This seat taken? What are you doing here? I was worried about you. You were worried about me? That's sweet. Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company. Reed? - I was just resting my eyes. - So I see. The new readouts look very promising. Not promising enough. When are the next tests? I've run out of plans. So I was thinking maybe... There's always me. No. It's too soon. - Reed? - I should get back to work. - You need a break. - Sue, not now, please. Come on. Let's go. Remember our first date here? God, I was nervous. You know, I bribed the projectionist $10 to keep the place open late. Really? I gave him $20. - No. - Yeah. - No way. - Yeah. I didn't want that night to end. You were right. It wasn't complicated. I just wasn't ready to... You always talked about how you kind of liked the man... who would approach you, speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you exactly what he wanted. I did. But I wanted you to be that man. Well, why didn't you say something? Reed, I'm saying it now. Excuse me. I know it's not easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue, or Johnny. At least they can still go out in public. But for you... If you're trying to cheer me up, you're doing a hell of a job. You know what I mean, Scarface? I'm just saying I know what it's like to lose something that you love... to see it slip away and know it's never coming back. Look. Reed is gonna fix me up, okay? For your sake I hope you're right. Look, he's a brilliant man. We should all trust that he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend. So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? I mean, other than spending more time with Sue. - Wow, I had no idea. - It's true. Yeah. I have that effect on people. Ben. So you remember my name now, do you? Do you also remember what you swore to do... with every breath in your body? We're working as hard as we can. Yeah. I can tell. - Victor was right. - Victor? Ben, I don't know if this thing will change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longer. Reed, look at me! I am looking. That's why I can't make a mistake. I've gotta get it right and it's not right yet! We need to test it! I spent my whole life protecting you, and for what? So you can play Twister with your girlfriend... while I'm the freak of the week? Ben, stop it! - You stay out of this, Susie! - Stop it, or I will. Get off me, rubber boy! You guys, quit it. Calm down! Good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back. 'Cause I ain't doing it no more. You two are on your own. Look what the marketing guys gave me. Look, check it out, listen. You're gonna love this. It's clobbering time! It's catchy, right? Isn't that great? That was the prototype. - Johnny, have you seen Ben? - Yeah, Sunshine just left. Look, Sue, I'm sorry. I can't stand this freak show. - I gotta get back to the real world. - You're calling that the real world? Sue, stop. You're not Mum. Don't talk to me like I'm a little boy, okay? Maybe I would if you stopped acting like one. Do you even hear yourself? Who do you think you are? Why is everyone on my ass? If you guys are jealous, that's fine. I didn't expect it to come from you, though. You really think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them, Johnny! Let's try something new. You live your life, I'll live mine. Sound good? And just for the record, they love me! Oh, God. Reed. Oh, my God, Reed. What did you do? - I can make it work. - No! I need more power to control the storm. More power? - You need a doctor. Come with me. - Sue. - One more try... - You need to rest. Leonard, bring me our lab rat. Ben. Come in. What is this? Where's Reed? Where do you think? With Sue. I'll take it from here, Leonard. Yes, sir. What do you want, Vic? To help you. The machine is ready. But Reed said it wouldn't... He also said we'd avoid that storm in space... but we all know how that turned out. He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic. - And you can? - Yes. Tell me... do you want to be Ben Grimm again? Thank you. Vic? Vic, it worked. Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields. Oh, my God. The machine worked for me. It can work for you, too! It did, Ben. It worked perfectly. - You planned this. - I've always wanted power. Now I have an unlimited supply. And no Thing to stand in your way. Take a good look, Ben. This is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny. One down, three to go. Vic? Right on cue. Ben? - What did you do? - Exactly what I said I would. I built a better, stronger being. And outsmarted the great Reed Richards. If you've exposed yourself to the storm, you're endangering your life. - You need help. - You always know best. So tell me, what happens when you superheat rubber? No! Mr. Von Doom, are you okay? Never better, Jimmy. Why the long face? Let's talk in my office. Ben. Sue! Johnny, the machine worked! Give me a hand. Come on. Get his arm. You all right, Ben? Put him on the step. What happened, big guy? I leave you for five minutes... The machine. Vic used it on himself. He was affected by the cloud like us. - Where's Reed? - Vic must have taken him. Dr. Richards, allow me to begin your lesson. Chemistry 101. What happens to rubber when it's supercooled? Give up? That's not like you, Reed. After all, we're both doctors. Painful? You don't know the meaning of the word. Just a little something from our defence contracts. Let's check in on the rest of the family, shall we? We gotta get out of here! Wait a minute. I got an idea! - Don't even think about it. - Never do. What are you doing? Johnny, no! Come on, flame on! We have to help Reed. It's too dangerous for you now. You have to stay here. What did I do? Come on, think! Two down, two to go. Sue. - What has he done to you? - How romantic. Victor, please. Call me Doom. The machine works. It worked on Ben, it can work on you. We can turn you back. Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts? Victor, you always thought you were a god. Now back off. Susan, let's not fight. No. Let's. Susan, you're fired! Marco. Polo. Did you say goodbye to your brother Johnny? It's time to end this! No, Vic. It's clobbering time. Damn, I've been waiting to do that. Susie, you okay? Victor ain't that bad, huh? ""He's just a little larger than life,"" right? Maybe next time you'll listen to me before... Ben! - Sorry, ladies. - Stop the car! Pull over. Hit the brakes! This is the police. Put your hands up and step down from the vehicle! Take him out! Ladies, I'm gonna need to borrow your car. - The transmission sticks. - Not gonna be a problem. I can't let you do that! Reed? I'll be right with you. Hello, Susan. You three are pathetic. You missed me. Had a little relapse, huh? - Welcome back. - This is gonna be fun. I can't hold it! Johnny, supernova! I thought we agreed that was bad. Now! - Ben! - Gotcha. Sue! Think you can contain it? Flame on, kid. Is that the best you can do? Time for your lesson. Chem 101. What happens when you rapidly cool hot metal? Ben! You done good, kid. Come on. Sue, you okay? Yeah. Man, I love this job. Job, huh? Well, we do have the suits. Ladies, your drinks. - I don't think we need another. - Just one more. Thank you, thank you so much. Cheers! I need names and shots. Bartender! They're custom-made, 36 EEEE. Well, look. I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. And I think if I can rework the power settings... Forget about it, egghead. I'm good as is. Better than good, baby. You just need to work on your touch. I like the sound of that. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. Thanks. I found a broken gasket from space. A gasket? - Reed, come on, we're at a party. - And if one of us were to wear it... No more thinking. No more variables. Sue Storm... will you marry me? Sue, you kind of need to say something. Yes. That's my nose, genius. These are my lips. She's kissing him. That's so cute. About time, you guys. No more wisecracks about the way I look. Call me Mr. Sensitivity. Okay. Wide load coming through. Everybody move, he's huge. - Come here, Mr. Sensitive. - Flame on. Showoff! How long will it be? Should be about 12 days.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Fantastic_Four-120667
Voyage Into Space (1970) - full transcript,"A made-for-TV film compiling five of the 26 episodes of the TV series Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot (1967). Specifically, these were the first two episodes (#1 and 2), two episodes from around the middle of the series (#10 and 17) and the final episode (#26).","[WHOOSHING] NARRATOR: Out of the incredible far reaches of outer space, a weird flying saucer enters the solar system. Its destination, a planet with a single moon, the green planet, earth. Soon the fantastic vessel is within the outer levels of earth's atmosphere, continuing its inexorable course toward the planet. Radar screens on the earth pick up the saucer as an unidentified object. UFO is approaching our sector. Jet squadrons investigate. Jet squadrons investigate. [WHOOSHING] Intruder, attention! We demand that you reveal your identity! What is your purpose in flying over this sector? Acknowledge! Acknowledge! All planes, ready to attack! Acknowledge! Acknowledge! [GUILLOTINE LAUGHING] I identified myself! I am Emperor Guillotine from the planet Carpotha and my purpose? I have come to conquer the earth! Now feel the power of the Emperor! We are under attack! [WHOOSHING] NARRATOR: The flying saucer dove into the sea, disappearing far into the depths of the Pacific Ocean. For many months, it did not reappear. And authorities began to believe it was destroyed. Then strange things began to happen in the Pacific. It seems so quiet. But the quiet sea is dangerous these days. Dangerous? And why is it dangerous, mister? Do you really want to know? You want me to tell you? Right in this area, ships have disappeared without a single clue as to how. They must have been attacked and sunk somehow. You know, it won't do any good to let it scare you. I'm glad that you take that attitude. There's much less passengers aboard the ship than usual. You have a lot of courage for a boy your size. But I'd rather be tall, like you! You will! We're right in the most dangerous area now. Listen. We'd better stay alert! Sure! You made this trip, mister? Knowing the danger? Mmm. You see, I'm Jerry Mano and in the Unicorn... That is... I mean, I'm a writer. -Now you tell me your name. -Me? I'm Johnny Sokko! Nice to meet you! My pleasure, Johnny. [BEEPING] Sorry, Johnny. This is Unicorn Agent U3. Will you acknowledge? Chief, we've contacted U3. Good. This is Azuma. U3, any action? JERRY: Well, the water is sort of rippling and, uh, there's a couple of fish I can see playing. Cut that out. This is no joke. I'm sorry, sir. Who is he talking to? It's strange. I'll call you just as soon as anything happens. You better call! What a grouch. [RUMBLING] [BOTH GRUNTING] Look there! Look at that! [GROWLING] -Oh, help! -Look at that! Oh, help! Help me! Johnny, that must be the monster that's been causing all the sinking! It's awful. Mr. Mano, we better get into the water and quick! Let's go! Oh! Oh! Oh! -About ready to go? -Yes! Hang on to me, Johnny! -Johnny! -Mr. Mano! [BOTH GRUNTING] [COUGHING] Mr. Mano? Mr. Mano? Oh, oh. Well, Johnny, we survived the ship wreck. But where, where are we? I'm not sure. That monster. What was that thing anyway? Dracolon. I've got to check in. Unicorn, Agent U3 reporting to headquarters! U3 reporting! Come in! Acknowledge! Acknowledge! No good! My transmitter's dead. Let's look around, Johnny. MAN: Hold it! [LAUGHING] You're too slow, friend. I'll blast the boy if you try it. [LAUGHING] You had better cooperate. We know you're a Unicorn agent. No, you wrong! MAN: You liar! U3, you are going to tell us just what you know about us! I don't know a thing! All right then. We'll do it the hard way! -Take the brat! -Right. Let go! Stop! [GRUNTING] -You, Johnny! -Coming! MAN: Get them! Fire! No! Don't shoot! You'll hit me! Fire, fire! [GROANING] [YELLING] -It's a dead end! -We're trapped! Blast 'em! [WHIRRING] What is that? Tremendous! A giant robot! Jump down. What a fantastic robot. He must be about 100 feet tall! He sure is a giant! Quick! Follow me! Oh! Quickly, this way. Hurry! Say. Who are you? My name is Dr. Lucius Guardian. The Gargoyle Gang's beenforcing me to build that robot so they can use it to conquer the world! Building it? You took a pretty big chance, helping us. But now you must try to get away! It'll soon be completed! It'll be the most powerful thing on earth! When the Gargoyles have that robot, nobody'll be able to stop them, because no power can stop the robot. You mean it isn't ready yet? No. Giant Robot is ready. All he needs is atomic power to activate his brain. Then his controls will be operating and with this, this miniature transmitter, he will be under the control of the first voice that is recorded in his electronic brain. Really? With this microphone? Hey, Giant Robot, start to move! Johnny, no! Well. The Gargoyle Gang is going to lose. I've planted an atomic bomb that will explode in 5 minutes. They're coming this way! -You? Did you see them? -No! You? Any sign of them? Hey! JERRY: What're you doing? Go on, run! I'll hold them off! It's the spies! Get 'em! [YELLING] Look! It blew up the whole hill! He sure meant what he said! Gee. The giant robot is gone. Look! The giant robot is good as new! Now, Giant Robot, into motion! He's moving! And at your command, too! You know what? It was the explosion! It must've been the radiation. It was just strong enough to activate his brain. Uh-huh. He would obey the first voice he heard, Dr. Guardian told us. It's you! Remember? What? What did you say? Oh! This is the control! Johnny, listen! What a break! Remember? You spoke into the mike? Now he will obey you! Tell me what to do! Might as well try to get a ride along with him. Then we call Chief Azuma and see what he says. Johnny, go on. Try. Giant Robot, please take us home to Tokyo now! Let's go. Take off, Giant Robot! They have stolen the flying robot! Very well. I shall teach them a lesson! Mighty One! Gargoyle Gang, Spider reporting. Spider, you will order the Dracolon to attack them immediately! We obey your command, sir. Now then, our conquest is under way. The Dracolon goes into action. His target will be Tokyo! [GROWLING] Look! What is this! Run, run! This is Agent U3, in the air and going to Tokyo. I don't need your jokes right now! Right this minute, the Dracolon is attacking Tokyo! The Dracolon! Tokyo! That monster! Giant Robot, hurry! [GROWLING] -Look! -What is it? A robot? MAN: What is it? Okay, Johnny, let him go. Giant Robot, destroy Dracolon! That kid is controlling the giant robot. Let's go! I'll handle the Gargoyle Gang. Johnny, you just command the robot! Spider, give up! Stop him. Fire! Giant Robot, use the jets! The atomic punch now! Use your rocket missiles! It's dead! JERRY: Johnny Sokko! Johnny Sokko, thanks. Dracolon is wiped out. Say, Johnny, he's amazing, this giant robot! Mr. Mano, I'll bet the Gargoyle Gang will try again. The giant robot is airborne! I want that giant robot caught! -Its course! -Right. Can't do it! Amazing! It's moving so fast, it can't be tracked! Ah! [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] NARRATOR: One of the largest meteorites ever seen has indeed landed in the Hikoni Mountains. Resting at the edge of a hill, it could roll down at any time. The defense forces are dispatched to check it. Spider! Oh. Hail, Guillotine! Spider! Have you located the flying robot? Well, I, uh... The giant robot is right now in the hands of the enemy. The giant robot has been captured by the Unicorn Organization and it's controlled by a boy named Johnny. I cannot fulfill the total plan of earth conquest as long as the flying robot is in the hands of the enemy! You must succeed or suffer the consequences. Yes, sir! Can you suggest a method? You idiot! Why do you think I had the Nucleon monster sent to earth? Then you mean we will use the monster? Of course! Unleash the Nucleon! The robot will try to stop it and then you will capture the flying robot! Do you understand? I do, sir! By Gargoyle, I will promise you that robot is going to be ours! Good! NARRATOR: Meanwhile, back at the Unicorn Organization lab, Flying Robo is undergoing tests. SCIENTIST: We are ready now. AZUMA: Ah. All personnel, you can begin the heat resistance testing! The full voltage, power on! [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Can he do it? Uh-huh. Astounding! That's enough. Power off! Well! The temperature was up to over 3,000 degrees! I'm astonished it didn't melt. Mmm. -This is great, isn't it? -Yeah. There is no weapon on earth, according to those tests, that can damage that robot! Station 1 here, on the hill. Nothing to report now. What'll they do with it, that crazy rock? Well, I hope we don't have to haul it down the road. That's a load! It's a meteorite. It's just a hunk of rock! Oh! What's that sound? Oh. Oh, I think that stone is causing it. He's right. I think that's what it is! Listen, call headquarters quick! Uh, come in! Come in, headquarters! Headquarters, this is Station 1 calling! -Headquarters, come in! -[GROANING] [YELLING] What is it? Run! -Answer! -What's wrong on the hill? Answer! -Listen. -What? There. Quick! Get back! That giant robot is under your control, Johnny. The Unicorn Organization works for world peace. Will you join us, Johnny Sokko? The world needs your help now, Johnny. The Gargoyle Gang wants to conquer the earth! They will strike again with strange and terrible weapons! That is true. And it is when they launch new attacks, only the giant robot will be able to stop them. I will join you. I want to help save the world! You're a great kid, Johnny. Thank you. Now. I'm proud to say this young man is now a Unicorn agent. To be known as U7. Aye! U7. Congratulations. Just one more thing. Do not tell anyone your status as an agent. Only we know who you are around here. Do not talk even to your parents. Aye! On my word! I will promise! Commander! Sir? Well, what is it? Well, that big meteorite that landed in the Hikoni Range, a great ball was in it, sir, and now it's rolling down the hill. Must've been a Gargoyle Gang trick then. U3? U7? I'm ordering you to the scene at once! -Go! -BOTH: Aye! Be careful. Johnny Sokko? Good luck. Carry on. Johnny, you ready? Uh-huh. Attack! Johnny, look! There it is! That's right, and rolling toward the town! The Nucleon is moving! Now let's see what the robot can do about the Nucleon. [ALL LAUGHING] [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Help! Hurry! Hurry! I'm afraid the town is doomed. I better call the robot. Giant Robot! Come! The giant robot is in the open! Now we will steal it back! Ah! At last! Giant Robot, the ball. Giant Robot, destroy that thing! Punch hard! All your might! [GRUNTS] He did it! That's what I call a great robot, huh? Go and get me the robot! Giant Robot, use the hand missiles! Oh, behind! Look out! It's that rotten boy again. Now, Robot. Attack! We have to get that kid. When we grab the boy, the robot will just stand still. Right. Come on! Now look! Grab him! You fool! Johnny, run! Ow! I'm coming! You must control the robot. So run! Right! No, wait! [GRUNTING] Go catch that kid! Stop! -Let go! -Ah, we got him. No! Let go, you cowards! You must be a member of the Gargoyle Gang! You're right. And I'm the boss of all the Gargoyles. See, I'm Spider! I want you to sleep. There. Get them into the car. Right. Come on, come on! Oh, look there! The giant robot is completely helpless! [LAUGHING] Nucleon! Now you will bring that robot! Commander! Giant Robot is moving strangely. Hmm. U3 and U7 are in danger! To the rescue. ALL: Aye! Now, Chief, what shall we do with them? Giant Robot won't make a move without that kid. So the kid will go to the laboratory where he can be brainwashed by the Hypnoton. Ah, what about this tall one? Shall I blast him? No, we can shoot him later. I want all the Unicorn agents and he will tell me who they are. Hmm. I understand. Then we can get rid of everybody, right? With the giant robot obeying us and Unicorn broken up completely, then the world will be in our power for sure. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] At last, the giant flying robot is mine! [TIRES SCREECHING] They're blocking the road! Push it away! Right. [YELLS] Oh! It's Unicorn! [GROANS] Gargoyles, you better surrender! You're surrounded! I'm going to bring in the machine. Nucleon! Nucleon! Look! Nucleon, destroy the Unicorn squadron. [LAUGHS] How do you like that? That's great! Yeah, that is beautiful! We don't have a chance here! Oh! That shooting! Jerry! Wake up! Wake up! Huh? It's the Nucleon! Oh! They'll be slaughtered! Commander Azuma's out there! Johnny, Giant Robot! Giant Robot, come! Confound it! The robot is moving! Oh! Here it comes again! Hit the dirt! -Are you hurt? -No, sir. Got to keep moving! There! Johnny, where is that robot? There he is. See? -Oh, Giant Robot! -Oh! After them! -Now, Johnny! -Giant Robot, the Nucleon! Up and away! Confound it! -He's coming closer! -Run! -Get to the car! -Hey, hurry! Now, Johnny! Giant Robot, you must stop the enemy at once. -Yeah, let's go, let's go! -Come on! -Let's get out here! -We got to get out of here! That's it. Giant Robot did it! Good! Great! [ALL LAUGHING] If they think they are through with the Emperor Guillotine, they're sadly mistaken! I shall never give up! And I shall conquer in the end! -This is nice, huh? -[BOTH LAUGHING] Yes. Ah! What is that? Oh, oh! [YELLING] [LAUGHING] Executioner, it's perfect. The earthlings will certainly be confused. Oh, I can see that. Although, why do we have to bother with the lake? You see, the Gargoyle vine is inactive in the water. The lake had to be completely drained. To bring the plant into action against these stupid earth men! Emperor Guillotine! We are doing well! Operation Lake was successful! We will soon reach our goal, to conquer this planet, Master! Don't make mistakes, Botanus! Remember, there is still much to do! Yes. Understood. Our plan now goes into phase number two, sire. It is very well prepared. I, Botanus, will not fail. [YELLING] -Oh, Commander! -Commander! -Commander! -How are you? Just a scratch. It's all right. I'm hard to kill. -You can go. -BOTH: Aye! Who do you think ordered the shooting, sir? -Bet it was the Gargoyle Gang. -Hmm. There's no doubt. It was the Gargoyles. Look. -What's that? -Hmm. This is the bullet that hit the car. I took it to ballistics for a check. [Botanus LAUGHING] -What? -What? Botanus: You are all doomed. Why not surrender? -Darn bullet! -No, don't touch it! It might explode! Botanus: You don't have a chance! Once the Gargoyle vine is turned loose, the earth will be demolished! Surrender now while you still can. We might let you live. [Botanus CONTINUES LAUGHING] Open it. Tape recorder inside it. So that's it. And he was talking about that vine! The space plant! Dr. Dorian is the one to talk to, Commander. It makes... It makes sense! Dr. Dorian knows just how it grows. Right. Well, you did quite well, Dangor. [LAUGHING] I think that bullet scared... Scared Commander Azuma as we'd planned. No? Dangor the Executioner, I'm a good shot. Good. And now you will go and kidnap Dr. Dorian, the great scientist. Go, right. [GASPS] Oh! What're you doing? No, please! Who are you? [GROANING] Come on! [GRUNTING] Come on. Take that, Unicorn. Look out! -The doctor! -Right! -Doctor! -Doctor? -Dr. Dorian? -Doctor! -Doctor? -Doctor! -U7! -Right! -Doctor, try to wake up! -Doctor? -It's all right, Doctor! -Doctor! -Dr. Dorian? -Doctor? Doctor! It's the Gargoyle vine! I thought it was dead! They must've brought in another Gargoyle vine. But how come it's just standing there? Yes, Dr. Dorian. The thing seems like it's dormant or something like that. Oh, yes, right now it is. It needs a source of additional energy. I understand. Doctor, could it be destroyed with bombs? No, no! The worst thing! That thing will draw energy and grow at any explosion! I know it would grow stronger! -It would? -Aye? We should stop the attack, you say? That's right. You really can't do it! It'll be a catastrophe! The whole story is just nonsense. Sure, those scientists keep trying to tell us what to do! You know? I just don't listen! Yes, we attack tomorrow morning. I will not listen to that old man! Listen to us! Please wait! Hello! Hello? -What's wrong? -Commander? Commander? What did he say? I'm sorry. That's it. They wouldn't believe that I know what I'm saying. They must think that Dr. Dorian is mad! Aye? No. Men like that minister are the ones who are mad! They should listen to the scientists! But I guess they won't. That's all. On target. Good hit! Oh! Go on! Make another bombing run! What? It destroyed all those airplanes? Yes, another air squadron was sent right on in. [AIRPLANE WHIZZING] [LAUGHING] Well, there goes another plane. When will they learn? They can't win against the Gargoyle vine. [SNICKERING] Report. All is well, Great One. We're winning! Those idiots attacked the Gargoyle vine! The second phase of our master plan and it went as expected. [LAUGHING] Good thus far, Botanus. Now launch the third phase into action! Yes. -Commander! The second attack squadron has been destroyed! -[ALARM BLARING] They can't hurt that Gargoyle vine! All towns have been evacuated! I see. Doctor? Well, it turned out as you said it would. That weird plant is growing! Doctor, Doctor! How can we stop that plant? We can't. We can't do it! Doctor! New orders! To all Unicorn branches. -On the alert. Condition Red status. -Aye! -U3. -Aye. Now Gargoyle might try to throw the area into panic. You must lead all our agents. -Help the refugees to safety. -Aye! -U7. -Aye! Take Giant Robot to the lake bed. Stand ready to assist all Unicorn agents. -Roger! -Roger! Oh... Commander, it's worse! That thing is throwing red-hot projectiles! No, what kind are they, Johnny? They're made of burning lava, sir. Can I have Giant Robot attack the plant now? Commander, let the giant robot attack! Right now! JOHNNY: The Gargoyle vine is getting stronger! -Commander! -Doctor? Give the order, sir! I'm sorry. The time is not right. U7, do not launch an attack until I order it! Aye! Oh, come on, follow me. Hurry. [ALL SCREAMING] This way. Follow me! Let's go! Hold it! Teacher! All the children are here, aren't they? Gozumi! Two are missing. -They are? -I must go! -No, don't! -Gozumi! -Oh, the children! -Wait! -No! -Teacher! -No! Let go. -You can't go! -It's dangerous! -Gozumi! Gozumi! Gozumi! CHILDREN: Oh! Help us! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Gozumi! Oh! Oh, Gozumi, go! Hey, teacher. Giant Robot, rescue the two kids down there! Giant Robot is here! CHILD 1: Look! Giant Robot! Hurry! Hurry! Now get aboard! Let's go! Oh, come on! -He did it! -TEACHER: He saved them! [GASPS] This is U7. The bombing is terrible! Your orders, please, sir? Please let me attack. Giant Robot can destroy that thing! JOHNNY: Commander! Commander! U7. Hold on. Johnny. Don't go near that thing! You understand? It's entirely too strong now! Oh! That darn plant! Oh! Commander, the dam is uphill. I'm sure Giant Robot could break it down and release the water. Commander? Just a minute! There it is! The dam is right there. That's it! It could work! The water held in that dam could easily pour down! That will make the heat energy go way down in the plant! Now then, that will cause the mouth to relax! Then when it opens, shoot rockets into the mouth! That'll do it! It will, it will! Good! That's it! U7, Commander here! -Destroy that dam right now! -Roger! Giant Robot, you will break the dam down! Giant Robot, power punch now! That's it! Good, Giant Robot! -Boy, look at that! -He did it! Giant Robot, you can start your attack. Giant Robot, now, hit him with rockets! [FIRING] You did it! Good work, Giant Robot! -Hooray! -Hey, great! It's all over! Hooray! Hooray, hooray! I will give you one last chance to destroy Unicorn! Yes. [GASPS] Oh! Oh! [ROARING] Ah! [GRUNTING] [ROARING] We swallowed up a whole express train. Unicorn will not know what happened. Doctor, I have our new prisoner here! Good. And I will handle the interrogation. We already know you're Suzuki, chief of the Unicorn Organization branch in Kyoto! And you're the only witness to our swallowing the train. How do you like that? Oh, no! You killed all those passengers in order to capture me? Humans wouldn't do that! No, they don't. And it's a good thing. Since Gargoylians do. NARRATOR: And so a train and all its passengers just vanished from the face of the earth. But Suzuki, sir, did he just disappear? Unicorn has planned a world conference. Kyoto was the location and Mr. Suzuki was in charge. Commander, there's something strange about this. There sure is. They caused that train to vanish. Just so that they could get Suzuki. Then Gargoyle must've done it. Hmm. So that means Gargoyle knew we'd been planning to hold this meeting, although it was secret. It means we must tighten security. I'm certain they will take much more action against us. We must take action. I am sending you two to Kyoto immediately. What they want is in there. That contains your orders and they are in code. Your orders are to decipher the code and proceed accordingly as is your profession. Aye. BOTH: Hail, Guillotine! [LAUGHING] Is it true the world Unicorn is going to hold a meeting? -Yes. -Where will it be? -Kyoto. -Where in Kyoto? -I don't know. -You don't? You must know that! I'm sorry. They won't stop me! I'll show Unicorn exactly how I operate! Good news! Doctor, we now know just where their headquarters are! Good. That does it. It'll be easy now. We're going to go get them! You, get him ready for surgery. Right. [MACHINES WHIRRING] Unicorn, let us start this session with a moment of prayer for our friend, Suzuki. With me. Who's there? -Suzuki! -It's our chief! Wonderful! Good to see you! I want to talk to you. -You will sit down. -Sure, sure. Listen. U3, Tokyo. I want to know all the details on this conference that we're going to hold. You know that it's all confidential information. I can't tell you anything right now. So don't you trust me? I must see the orders that are in that briefcase. I'm handling the plans for the summit meeting. JERRY: I can release these documents only on the Commander's orders! So, I don't like it. Where are you both staying in Kyoto? Oyo Hotel, Room 414. Oh, sir! It's really you, sir! It's good to see you! We thought you were dead! GIRL: Papa! WOMAN: I'm so glad! Go to bed. It's getting late. -Papa! Papa! -Mr. Suzuki, sir? I don't get it. I think my papa is sick. Dr. Botanus. Do you know where they are sleeping? 414 and it's the Oyo Hotel. Oyo Hotel? Who is he talking to? He said Room 414. I wonder who's in there. -Better check it. -Right. There's no bugs. Looks like it's safe enough in here. I wonder about that man! Suzuki, I mean! Yes. That's why I told him where we're staying. It's possible they got control over him. I'm not taking chances. No, we can't! -Then it looks like sure trouble tonight. -Hmm. You said it. Who ordered that? Must be a room mistake. I'm sure there is no mistake, sir. -[LAUGHING] -Huh? -Oh! -Drop the guns. [LAUGHING] I just came to get this case. Just what I wanted. And you get this! Oh! [GRUNTING] Stop. [GASPING] Let's get them! JERRY: They just vanished! -Doctor? -Yes? The briefcase contained only this! What? Oh! That is not exactly what you wanted, aye, Doctor? They'll be sorry about this, I assure you. They embarrass me. They won't get away with that! I'll send the Gorian into action again! You mean your papa's acting strangely? Yes, he looked like Papa, this man. He wasn't nice like Papa! Honest! What happened? Tell us. I don't know. He wasn't Papa. Not my papa. What are you doing here at this hour? Suzuki, you're acting suspiciously, sir. We must make sure you're our man. That's nonsense! Absolutely stupid! Why, you know I'm Suzuki! Don't you? I'm sorry. Rika, here, says you're not her papa, not at all. Huh? You must come with us, to headquarters. Why should I? [GRUNTING] Hey, taxi! All right, get in. -Oh! We're on the wrong road! -What? Now! Stop the car! Do as I say! I'm warning you! All right! Ah! He's been transmoculated. Just like me. His mind is under control. He underwent an operation, same as I did. Our bodies are not like yours at all. We are under Gargoyle control. Gargoyle? Communicator! Send a code to... I'm trying. Commander? U7 must be trying to mobilize Giant Robot. What? Do you know what you are saying? Oh, yes, sir. No question about it. It was too weak to activate the robot. U5, you're sure that it was a radio wave from U7 that you picked up? Yes! I'm positive! But that means that... Oh, Mr. Mano? U3? Hey, Johnny! Where are we? [LAUGHING] So you're awake, Unicornians. You are directly under Lake Biwa. Now, how do you like that? Dr. Botanus! Thank you. How nice you remember my name. How long you live now depends entirely on me. Oh. Now then. I want you to see this. [GASPS] Once the needle on this instrument starts to move, you will have five minutes to live, five minutes! [CLOCK TICKING] Watch it. Once it starts, it will not stop. Now do I get those documents? No. Do whatever you want! No matter what you do, you won't get what you want! Oh? That's too bad. You will die! [LAUGHING MENACINGLY] -He meant it. -So, I'm not going to be beaten! That's all. You call Giant Robot in quick! -But I can't do it! -Well, I'll fix that! Commander! The hotel room, sir! The attache case for the documents was there! That's good, and what about our agents? I'm sure that they're nearby. No, sir, I'm sorry. But... But they disappeared! Well, continue the search! We have an army out there! Kyoto was loaded with agents! -Tell them all to get busy! -Aye! The time is going by! Four more minutes! We will attack them in Kyoto and wipe them out. I'm going to break up that Unicorn gathering there by force! Okay, I'm ready! Go! And use the Gorian! Mmm. [SPLASHING] Commander, the men are all stationed! -Good, then let's get started. -Aye! Hurry, Jerry! -I did it! -Marvelous! Call, quickly. Giant Robot! Giant Robot! Giant Robot, Giant Robot, listen! Biwa Lake, we need you now! -Commander, we're picking up U7! -The giant robot? He'll be here soon! That means they're all right! -Not dead! -Well, then, uh, trace the signal! -Find out where they are! -Aye! [GROWLING] -Our tank corps is here, sir! -Oh. Oh! [ROARING] -Ah, over there! -Oh. [ROARING] One minute left. One minute! But we can make it! Giant Robot, destroy that Gorian! Thirty seconds more! [GROWLING] ALL: Hooray, hooray! We did it! [GURGLING] No! That robot's ruined things once again! Doctor! Doctor! The robot's coming here! What? [GROANING] [SCREAMING] Get Suzuki loose! The giant robot can take us all out! JOHNNY: Roger! Look at that! This is U3 and U7. Commander, you must have worried about us! Yes, I sure did. It's all right. -What about Suzuki? -Suzuki is here with us, but he's pretty weak right now. All right.We'll bring him to a hospital. Then his transmoculation can be corrected. Good. Roger. This is Unicorn Japan, Unicorn Japan! [BEEPING] Wait a second! That's not a Unicorn wave length! It's the Gargoyles! Then we must know where that signal originates. It could be getting ready to attack us! -Well, U3, U7! -BOTH: Aye! Use a portable tracker. -I want that signal located! -BOTH: Aye! [WHIRRING] Oh, there it is! [BEEPING GETS LOUDER] This is it! This is where that signal originates! All right. Come on, let's go! Here we go. Gee whiz! Pretty weird, isn't it? Yeah, it sure is. -[LAUGHING] -Come on out! Show yourself! In there! Welcome foolish agents of Unicorn! Shoot! Oh, a tape machine! Oh, I guess we've been fooled again! But why do this? -Let's go. -Hmm. -[JOHNNY GRUNTS] -Johnny! Are you hurt? Johnny? Urgent! Emergency! Please send an ambulance! WOMAN: Is Johnny hurt? Yes! Johnny's been shot! -Commander! -Not the boy! Hang on, U7! Courage! Oh, please don't die now! Robot won't listen to anyone else! We need you! Sniper reporting to our great emperor. U7 has been shot to death. He is, is he? Well, you show me his dead body! But... But, sir, sir, I... You idiot! They are taking him to a hospital! Make sure he's dead! Right. I will. Oh, oh! -Just making the rounds. -Yes, Doctor. This time I'll make absolutely sure you're dead, Unicorn agent! [GUN FIRING] -Oh, U7! -Hold it! -Halt! -You there! Well, the job is complete. Giant Robot, he'll be no trouble now. [CREAKING] Loose hood. That was close. This is U7 calling. U7 calling here, I'm in the enemy's car and I'm okay. He's all right. U7's a headache! I never know if he's alive! Aye, Pat, I wore this special jacket. You know, the iron one? When they shot me, but I wasn't hurt. All right. U7, where are you headed? JOHNNY: Probably right to Gargoyle headquarters. This guy thinks I'm dead. Good. The minute you get there, let us know. -Understand? -Roger. Looks like this is really it. AZUMA: We will attack as soon as we get the location from U7. Alert our forces. [LAUGHING] Unicorn morons! Don't they know that Guillotine hears every word they say? Fools! -[TIRES SCREECHING] -Oh! A monster? Emperor Guillotine! What is wrong? U7 was... U7 is alive in your trunk! You die with him. [SCREAMING] Oh, no! Oh, please, please, no! Oh, boy, I just can't get out! Robot! Giant Robot, I need you! Oh, please! Oh! Robot, red alert! Ah! Giant Robot is fighting the Gargoyle eye. It's going to be rough. U7, watch out! Gargoyle will mobilize all the monsters we had to conquer once before. It'll be dawn soon. Get rid of that eye! Robot, you must attack! Robot, mega-punch now! [LAUGHING] They're falling right into our trap! Oh, it's that saucer! Robot, look out! Lay down a smoke screen! Right. Commander, the saucer, big battle! U7. Do not weaken. Continue the battle at all costs. U7! Keep going! We'll soon be there! Oh, more Gargoyles! -Shoot that kid down! -Right. I'm in real trouble! Commander, enemy concentrated in the mountains! Quick! Location. It's 1-3-0-3, the mountain area! -Good. Go! -Aye! Snow, Commander! [SCREAMING] Oh, the monsters are coming out! Let's get out! Commander, look at that! We're entirely surrounded! U7! U7! Unicorn won't be bothering us much longer. Robot! Azuma's in real trouble! He needs you now! Yes, go and fight my monsters! Boys, just strike at them! [LAUGHING] Look at that! Quick, run, take cover! Idiots! Don't hit our own monsters! Take aim more carefully! -Oh, Robot! -Oh! [SCREECHING] [FIRING] Commander, don't worry about the monsters! Robot can handle that. Then we will attack the headquarters. -Well, sir, I'm ready! -Let's go! Robot, kill the monsters! Go! [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Oh! Attack! They're on the run! -Forward! -Fight! Fight, Gargoyles! Fight!

He's ready to go into action again now! -Oh, no! -Now I'll show you guys! Attack, Robot! Hooray, let's go! Nonsense! He can't attack me! If I am destroyed, the entire earth will blow up in a terrible nuclear explosion! -Do you hear? -U7, stop it quick! Robot, now stop! Don't do it! Stop the attack! I will destroy you all! Robot! What are you doing? Robot! Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot! Robot, please! Don't do it! You'll die! Robot! Robot, please come back! I need you here! Commander, that bright light! Guillotine is dead. And... Giant Robot! Robot, goodbye. I'm sorry you had to do it this way. Robot! Giant Robot! NARRATOR: And so the saga comes to an end.

View of Terror (2003) - full transcript,A stalker picks up the scent of a beautiful young woman.,"Sleep tight, baby doll. What happened between us was il miracolo. A miracle. How do you Americans say? A miracle of love. I would rather go to... France. We'll go wherever you choose. To the cafes in Paris, or perhaps to my castle in the hills above Saint-Tropez. Ooh. The beach, someplace tropical. Hot. There's no place hotter. We're steamier right here in this bed. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. So tell me what I'm doing wrong. Nothing. Then how come you are moving out? I thought you weren't gonna ask me again. Look, if you need some more privacy I can put up some walls. I need space. Why? I thought we weren't gonna argue about this, okay? I don't wanna argue about this. I'm just feeling a lot of pressure. What pressure? I never even mentioned the ""M"" word. This kind of pressure. We're talking. No, you are shouting. I'm not shouting. Brent, this is always what happens. Everything turns into a fight. We're not fighting, Celeste. We're having a discussion. I don't get it. You know, we are perfect together. Not just in bed. Everything's perfect. Yeah, except for the fighting and I can't stand it. I'm not saying that it's over, okay? I'm just saying that I need some time alone. Fine. Except for the Barkleys for some reason they can't sit beside the Robinsons and don't ask me why. Excuse me. This isn't clean. Um... Think you could check every plate before you put them down? Thanks. Did you ask about the apartment? Um... We can stop by there this afternoon. You didn't ask? Well, I was hoping you were gonna change your mind. Not that I don't want you for a neighbor. That would be great, it's just... I think you are making a mistake. Come on. He's gorgeous, talented, funny and he's an actor who actually finds work. You know, we still need to have the wine list approved. I know, you heard me.- So why are you leaving him? He worships you. The sex is great. We're always fighting. So what? He's passionate. I don't like it. You don't like it. Well, listen. After two failed marriages, I can say this with some degree of authority. You can't have great sex without passion. And you can't have passion without fighting. Sex and violence. No, no, not violence. Fighting. If you're gonna move, you can't beat this neighborhood. People are great. There's a 24-hour market right around the corner. Subway's only two blocks away. Let's go up to my place first, okay? Afternoon, Derrek. Hi. Our appointment isn't until 1:00. Fine. I can wait. Tasha. David. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. And you, you I recognize from Tasha's brochure. I'm David Jacobsen. Hi. I've been talking to your boss, trying to get her to use my club for one of her events. Yeah, the Second Sight Club over on 35th. I think I've heard of it. I should hope so. Yeah, we've completely remodeled. We'll talk, we'll talk. You... You'll love it. You guys have a great day. Even if I had a studio available, I couldn't lease it without a credit check. And that could take a while. Come on, Glenn. I've been here for five years. I'll co-sign. But I only have two bedrooms. Unless, of course, you wanna take a look across the street. What's across the street? The Sommer. Same company that owns The Sommer owns The Tower over here. It's not as fancy, but I could get you a one-bedroom there that rents for less than a studio space over here at The Tower. I like it better than The Tower. Certainly has more charm. Careful what you touch. I just had it painted. Furniture is nice. I'll rent it with or without. Either that or the floor. Wow. It's like a giant insect colony. Yeah, like those ant farms where you can see all the caves and tunnels. There's curtains up in the bedroom. But I haven't put up any drapes yet. So if you like the apartment, you can pick any color you want. What about security? Any problems with the building? There's the odd theft now and then. But nothing too serious. There's no high-tech cameras in this building. You saw the security doors and the guard across the street keeps an eye on the building. What about pets? Pets? No pets. Just a bird. A bird isn't a pet. Right? Bird? Yeah. It's not a problem. Great. Then we'll take it. You be quiet. Hi, I can't come to the phone right now. So, leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks. Tsk. Did I leave you out? Did I leave you out? I know. That's 'cause I don't want your friends calling here no more. Celeste. Are you living here now? Um, yeah, I just moved in. Well, let me be the first to welcome you to the hood. Thanks. I gotta go. No, I, I... Listen. I wanted to talk to you. You know what I said earlier, about you and I getting together? Strictly business? Come on. You know as well as I do, my club is the best venue out there for these parties and these social events. Okay, I don't choose the venues. I know. And neither does Tasha. All that we can do is recommend a place. But see, I want to be on that list of recommendations. All right. You know what? Let me see what I can do. Maybe we can swing by later. That would be amazing.Okay. Everything is on the house. Ooh. Sounds good. You have a good day. No, the shellfish is too expensive. Go with the salmon. And, we'll need a vegetarian option. Hang on. RSVP, Tasha speaking. Is she there? No. I think you are making a big mistake by calling her every day. I just want to talk to her. She just wants some time alone. Why is that so hard for you to understand? I don't understand why she left. You want the short answer or the long psychological evaluation? I'm going crazy, Tasha. You've always been crazy, Brent. In fact, I, I probably never should have introduced you. I miss her. I want her back. I don't care what it takes, okay? I'll do anything. Hello. Hi. Who's this? It's me. Brent? How did you get this number? What did you do today? Tasha gave it to you, didn't she? Yeah. Okay, well, I told you not to call. I like your voice. It's heavenly, like your name. Why did you stop talking? Hi, I can't come to the phone right now. So, leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks. Sleep tight, baby doll. The number you are calling has been blocked and cannot be accessed by this function. Please contact... Morning. Hi. Hope you're ready. They moved the appointment up by 15 minutes. We can take the subway. Hey, Derrek. Did you talk to Brent? He called me. Did you give him my number? No. No. He called me. Well... What did he say? He pretended it wasn't him. Did it sound like him? Well, he can sound like anybody he wants. Did you star-69 him? No, he blocked his number. I think he was calling from right outside the building. Why is that? Because I heard a siren go by and then, I heard the exact same siren on the phone. That could be a coincidence. Well, he said, I have a heavenly name. That's not a coincidence. Block the blocker. What do you mean? Anonymous call rejections. Star-77. The party you are calling does not accept blocked calls. If you are calling from a blocked number please add... Now, tell me what she does that's so special? I, um... I doubt she does anything that you can't do. But there is a difference. What's that? She's afraid. I'm not. Afraid of what? Conflict. And you can't change that. Why not? Because... Well, in order to change Celeste, you have to confront her. If you confront her, she'll run away. She's from Ohio, for God's sake. She grew up milking cows, playing softball. She just doesn't understand people like us. She moved out here right after her mom died. You knew that, right? Yeah. I guess she just packed up her bird and left. That wasn't her bird. That was her mom's. Whatever. That's just the way she is. Something goes wrong and she runs away. I think you should let me take your mind off her. You're really fun to flirt with. And if things were different, we could carry this right into the night. But I just... But you want someone else. Story of my life. It's not that I want her, Tasha. I never said this about anyone before, but, I need her. Why did you have these delivered here? Because the last time I sent them to the hotel, they lost them. Thank you. All right. Listen, I was thinking we're gonna have to hire some people to help us set up the room. And I had this list here I wanted to show you. If that's Brent, can you just tell him that I'm not here? Still? Got to talk to him sometime. RSVP, Tasha speaking. May I speak to Celeste, please? And can I tell her who's calling? Yeah, Mike from Baxter's Jewelers. Sure, hold on. Mike, from some jewelry store. This is Celeste. Hi. Who's this? It's me. You gave me almost nothing the other night. What do you want? I'll tell you what I've got. How did you get this number? Tasha gave it to you, didn't she? I'm just asking you for a little more. At night, I turn off all the lights and listen to your voice. I imagine you lying there in your silky thong. Running your fingers back and... Listen to me you sick bastard, you ever call here again, I'm calling the police. The number you are calling has been blocked and cannot be accessed... Big surprise. What do you wanna do, call the phone company? Okay, you don't think that that was Brent? No. No. Of course it's not Brent. Who else could it be? He knows my name, he knows where I live, where I work. Call him. Ask him. You call him. It's not Brent. He said that I wear a thong. So? So, Brent is the one who gave them to me. All right, um, I'll talk to him. Thanks. Hi, I can't come to the phone right now. So, leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks. Hello. If you hang up, you'll be sorry. How did you get this number? There are three rules to this game. First, you can't block your phone. Second, you can't call the police. Third, you can't have a boyfriend. If you break a rule, you'll be punished. Any questions? And I'll be watching you. Watching? Well, telescopes are pretty popular in these buildings. That's why, the first thing I want you to do is to cover up all your windows. Yeah, I was gonna do that today. Yeah. And then, you take off the anonymous call rejection. But then he can call me. See, what you need to do is get yourself a second line. You keep the number unpublished and unlisted. You give it out to your closest friends. That way, he keeps calling on the first line thinking he's getting through. But what he's really doing is giving us more information. So you can trace his call? Not if he is calling from a pay phone or using a calling card. Those calls are almost impossible to trace. But he might give us information if he leaves messages. I begged her not to go. I knew it was a mistake. What does her moving out have to do with this? Somebody's stalking her. That wouldn't happen if she stayed. And you think, what, if she moved back... Yeah, I think it would stop. Really? Well, that could be a motive right there. For what? Scaring her. You know, you are either innocent or you're a really good actor. Why can't I be both? Thank you. You are welcome. He told me not to call the police. That's why I waited till I was at work. Well, if he's watching, it might not make a difference. He could be out there right now. I know. Where are you going? I have to pick up the guest list for the banquet and, go to the hotel to check on the space. And then I have to find a new place to live. Well, hang on a second. If he is following you, he'll find out where you are no matter where you live. Right. But he won't be able to watch me through my living room windows. I'll see you later. Yeah. Okay. Right. No, that sounds totally fine. I need a taxi. Excuse me. I'm looking for Glenn Moser. He's at lunch. Do you know when he'll be back? Around 1:00. Right. Do you mind if I just wait here? No, ma'am. Thanks. You could look at the lease. There's nothing in here about harassment. Then I'm gonna have to sublet. There's a clause in here about that. Says you can't do it. All right, can I talk to the owner of the building? It's owned by a conglomerate. Who runs that conglomerate? They have a board of directors. And they'll just send you back to me. So it's really up to you? It's up to the contract. Look, I let a lady out of her lease last year. And I almost my job over it. All right, can you at least find out if there's an apartment with a telescope pointing into my living room? You know, I've been in a lot of these units. And you'd be amazed to see how many of them have telescopes. Great. So, um... Will you please put up my drapes? I'm working on it. And I'll tell security to keep an eye on things. It's the best I can do. Maybe I should just go back to Ohio. Ohio? And what about the lease? Well, I guess I could always send them the money when I have it. I co-signed for that lease. Guess who they're gonna come after. Yeah. Besides, you know. Maybe it's good that you're stuck here. Okay. What do you mean? I mean... You can't keep running away from everything. And I suppose that you would just throw open the curtains and start dancing naked for the guy. I might. But, I know that what I wouldn't do. Wouldn't count on the police to find him. You know what? Fight back. Right. And how do you do that when you don't know who you're fighting? Well, that's the first thing you gotta do. Find him. Okay. How do I find him? Same way he found you. Grab your things. Says here the viewfinder is a wide-angled sighting scope with cross-hairs to make it easy to center objects in the eye-piece. Well, I'm not having any trouble centering things. I can see why this is such a popular sport. Why you ask? Well, it's all rather phallic, isn't it? I mean, this long sleek tube penetrating to the most private parts of people's lives. Okay, we're not doing this to spy on people. You're such a spoilsport. Okay, I got one. Room on the 14th floor... Ninth window from the left. Can you see anybody? Um... No. Just the telescope. That makes 11. My God. What is it? Mrs. Tasgrove, butt naked. I did not need to see that. All right. So that makes 11 windows with telescopes... And then nobody using them. Now what? Now, we gotta get him to come to the window. How? Give him something to look at. I'm not taking these sheets down. Well... You have to bait the trap. You know... Tease them a little. I'm not doing that either. Of course not. All right. You look through the telescope. I'll do my best to get his attention. Somehow. Music. Lights. Action. Done this before? Hi, I can't come to the phone right now. So, leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks. Get a lot of hang-ups on that line? Yeah. That's why the new one's gonna be unlisted. Well, you shouldn't have any problem with this one. Hello. I thought we had an understanding about the police. How did you get this number? It's a pity. Because now you'll have to be punished. I don't know how he got the number. Are you sure you didn't give this number out to anybody but your boss? I'm positive. What about the person who installed the phone? Did you get a name? Um, it was a woman. We'll still check her out. I just got off the phone with the building manager. A Glenn Moser. He doesn't know if anybody's been inside the unit. Well, maybe it was him. Ma'am, just because he has the key doesn't mean he's been inside. All right, well, he's definitely watching me and following me. Which takes him out of the voyeur category. Meaning? He's behaving more like a predator. Could you just wait until I get inside? Yeah, sure. Thanks. The view is so much better now. Don't you think? Besides, putting up sheets won't stop me. I can see you anyway. For all you know, I could be hiding in the closet. Or I might be under your bed. Or maybe in the shower. Look around. I'm sure you'll find me. If not, I'll find you. Thank you. You had an intruder? Somebody came in and took the sheets down that I had over the window. Wait, wait, wait a minute. The police are in there now. I brought the drapery guys in. I let them in to measure the window. I was there the whole time. I stood in the doorway. And they took the sheets down? We had to. To take measurements. Well, why didn't you tell me? I tried to call. All I got was the machine. I left a note in your kitchen. You know, I did everything you wanted. I tried to put the drapes up as fast as possible. Or I might be under your bed. Or maybe in the shower. Look around. I'm sure you'll find me. If not, I'll find you. Um... It sure is creepy, but there's nothing on that tape that says he was actually inside the apartment. He's... He's just given us more to work with. I don't understand. Why is he doing this to me? See, this isn't about you. As an individual. Believe me. This is about control. It always is with these guys. Same as rape. Same as murder. We'll get to the bottom of this. Um... In the meantime, can we leave with that tape? You know, if you're scared to stay by yourself for the night, you might as well check into a hotel. It might do you some good. No... I, um... I'll be okay as long as he hasn't been in here. There actually is no guarantee that he hasn't been here. We just don't have any reason to believe that he has. Right. So, he's probably in his hidey-hole, watching right now? You know what the best thing you can do is? Put your sheets back up and lock the door. I'm sure you'll be just fine. I think you should leave the sheets down. Why? Because when they're down, he's watching. You know, I hate to sound stupid here but the, the logic of that just completely escapes me. Okay. The minute they came down, he called. Right? He even left a message. It's like he's spoon-feeding it to you. Spoon-feeding me what? He wants more than a silhouette on a bed sheet. He wants you. You're the bait. This is a pleasant surprise. Are you watching me? Always. What are you doing? Hiding. Why did you take down the sheets if you don't want me to see you? Why do you wanna see me? Because your voice is no longer enough. Do you want me to come back where you can see me? Please. And keep talking. Keep talking. Anything I can do to help, just let me know. I'll be more than glad to be of service. Really. Glenn. I found him. Excuse me. Can we talk later? Okay, but look... This is his apartment. It's on the 14th floor. What apartment? What are you talking about? The man that's been watching me. I saw him last night. I need his name so that the police can... The police can ask me for it if they want it. I can't give you the names of the tenants. The last time I did that I almost lost my job. What last time? It's not important. Are you talking about the woman that you let out of the lease? It's none of your business. All right, can you please just tell me who was she? What difference does it make? Well if it doesn't make a difference, why aren't you telling me? Her name was Jamisen. Justine Jamisen. All right. Where does she work? She worked at the flower shop over on 1st Avenue and St. Mark Street. But she quit the day she moved out. No forwarding address. Nothing. She just vanished. Excuse me. Hi. Um, so I just tried to call my friend Tasha Kinsley, but I think she must already have left. Yeah, 20 minutes ago. Could you do me a favor? Yeah. What do you need? Do you know why the police came to my apartment the other night? Yeah, ma'am. So I think I know who's watching me. He's on the 14th floor, ninth window from the south-east corner. Do you know who lives there? Let's see, that would be... Mrs. Dorrington. No. That's not right, it's... You know, could I just run up there and see what apartment number it is? You can't tell by the doors. Why not? Well, because it's different if you count the windows. I mean, most of them they have two windows. But the studios only have one and the two bedrooms, they have an extra one... Well. You know I can't let you go up there by yourself. Could you come up with me? No, ma'am. Can't leave your station? Nope. So, what if you have to go to the bathroom? Well, that's... That's different. I bet it takes longer to go to the bathroom than it does to take a ride in the elevator. I think this is it. Are you sure? I think so. Who lives here? I think it's David Jacobsen. What are you doing? I'm seeing who lives here. Well, he's not home. So then, can you open up the door? No, I can't open up the door. Look, I just wanna take a peek inside and make sure that we have the right place. How are we gonna tell anything just by peeking through the door? Because there's only one telescope on this part of the building. So, if there's one by the window, we know we have the right apartment. I, I can't do that. Derrek. Okay, I'm gonna call the police and what's gonna happen if they come up here and knock on the wrong door? How's that gonna look? Hey, you can't go in there. Don't worry. I won't touch anything. It's what you came to see. Now let's go. If he finds us here, we're... The police find your fingerprints on any of that stuff, I'm gonna lose my job. Come on. Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone that you let me into the apartment. All right? I'm just gonna say that I saw him watching me and... I owe you one. Thank you. Look, Detective Gillis it's Celeste Timmerman. Can you call me back quickly? I found something. Yeah. Are you David Jacobsen? Yes. I'm Detective Gillis, and this is my partner Detective Zamora. Do you mind if we ask you a couple questions? No, come on in. Hey, that is a one nice telescope, man. You don't mind if I take a look, right? Well, you really don't see too much in the daytime. All right, well, let's have a look. Yeah, you're right. I can't see a thing. So, what do you use it for? Come on. We're all voyeurs on some level, right? No. Not me. You? Not me. Wait, wait, you're gonna sit there and tell me that, that you've never looked at a beautiful woman across the room or taken a quick glance under her short skirt on an escalator? I mean, come on, guys. All right, then why don't you just tell me why you're here... Detective, you're not going to find anything illegal over there, there's... There's none of the kiddie stuff, none of the blue snuff films, I mean, I didn't even, cop a feel off the net. You know these women? Yeah. That's, Tasha Kinsley and Celeste, somebody. Why? Meh. Don't worry about that, man. What's this? I'm sure I don't know. He doesn't know. Well... Well, would you like to know? Hey, guys, I have nothing to hide. Open it. I swear I have no idea where these pictures came from, I have never seen these pictures before. Come on, let's go. Wait, wait. You two are making a huge mistake. That's not even the last of it. We're coming right back with a warrant. How could you think that you were protecting me? Tasha said somebody was stalking you. Yeah, it was you. I mean, before I started following you, she said he... He knew where you live, where you work. He wasn't following me. David knew where I worked. God! I'm just so angry. You have no idea how scared I was. I didn't mean to scare you. I was just afraid if I'd said something, you would tell me to butt out. I just feel like smacking you. Sorry, I mean, I... I've never seen you so angry. What you're seeing is a woman who has been visually raped for the last three weeks and who thought that maybe that rapist was you. But it was him all along. I should feel safe, but I don't. I'm sorry. You're right. There's no way I can understand. No. I swear I was trying to help you. Even though I made everything worse. Maybe... Maybe I made everything worse by leaving you. Where would you like to go? London, Barcelona, Tahiti? I would be happy just to go to the bedroom. Not just any bedroom. A Venetian bedroom at sunset. Overlooking the canals and the golden Basilica of San Marco. Amore. I have to go to work. Commercial? No, I'm auditioning for a play. Tickets. How beautiful you are. You're more beautiful in anger than in repose. I still feel like I'm being watched. I can't escape it. You are. I mean, I'm watching you. Kitty's watching you. Don't do that. I'm sorry. I don't like it. I didn't mean anything. Don't tease me about that ever again. Never again. That was good, by the way. What? It was almost like a fight. I'm growing up. Yeah. You wanna fight? Yeah. I'll give you a fight. Yes. Okay, well, I told you not to call. I like your voice. It's heavenly. Like your name. Why did you stop talking? We found that one in David's apartment, along with three more with your voice on 'em. A bunch more photographs and, a couple of video recordings made through the telescope. Video recordings? Yeah. But the only thing we didn't find was his camera gear. We will. But all that should nail him pretty well? Hope so. See, this guy's pretty clever, and his phone records are clean as a whistle. But that doesn't mean anything, right? Probably not, but there is one thing we need to warn you about. Um, he's gonna have a bail hearing on Monday. And he's probably gonna get out. So, I don't want you to be alarmed if you see him around. Yeah, you just be careful and, you know, you don't talk to him. Can I get a copy of those? Well, we need to keep them for evidence, but... Yeah, I suppose I can make you a copy. This is so humiliating. Do you know what they're going to do with those videos? I think they've just looked at it enough to make sure that was you. No, they're gonna show them to a jury. Yeah, I thought about that. It's disgusting. Well, you won't be alone in court, okay? I'll be right there with you. Thanks. I just can't believe I almost did business with that guy. Hello. You broke the rules, remember? No boyfriend! You have 24 hours to get rid of him. If you don't, I will. How is that possible? David's in jail. Maybe he called from jail? No, the cops said that there's no way he could've made that phone call from jail and he doesn't even get out till Monday. Has Brent ever heard his voice? It wasn't Brent. All right? He was following me, but he was just trying to protect me. Now you sound like me. It wasn't him. You said he can do any voice. He wouldn't do that. I don't wanna push this, okay? But suppose it was him all along. What do you mean? He's desperate, he wants you back. He told me he'd do anything. That I will never relax in my secrecy or in my search. That I will fasten the crime of the murder of my dear love. That I will fasten the crime of murder. That I will fasten the crime of murder. That I will fasten the crime of the murder. This is Brent. I talked to the police and they said that David made bail first thing this morning. So, since he's threatened you... I thought he couldn't have made the call. Well, he said he could have a friend call me, but that's impossible because it was the same voice. How do you explain that to a jury? I don't think you have to worry about it, I mean, they found all that stuff in his apartment. Yeah, well, the important thing is, is that you just stay away from my apartment. Why? Because he threatened you. He said that if I don't get rid of you, he will. And what about you? I'll be fine, I'll call you again later. Hi. May I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for a woman named Justine Jamisen? She's been gone for over a year now, sorry. She was an artist. I mean, not like a painter. I mean, with flower arrangements. Once somebody saw her work, they never went anywhere else. I offered to give her a raise so she wouldn't leave, but I'm glad she left. Why is that? I think she was on medication. She started having anxiety attacks, paranoia. What happened? Well, for one thing, she would never go near the windows. And when she left, she wanted to wipe out any trace that she was ever here. Like she never existed. Do you know where she went? No. Would you tell me if you did? Probably not. Do you ever hear from her? No. All right, um, look, if you do hear from her or anybody who knows her, can you just tell her to call me? It's really important, tell her it's about The Sommer. And I don't think that she was paranoid. Surprise! Hey! Are you crazy? How could you scare me like that? Um, sorry. What are you doing here? I just told you to stay away. I came to celebrate, I... I got the job. Jesus. Don't worry. I closed the drapes towards The Tower. I mean, nobody's gonna see us. Where's Kitty? Where is she? I have no idea. Well, did you take her out? No. Well, she was in here this morning. Well, maybe when you closed it, you thought she was gonna be in there. I haven't taken her out for two days! He was in here, he took her. How do you know he was in here? In the elevator. What? In the elevator, he left me a message. There's nothing in the elevator. On the back wall, in big letters. There's nothing there. He wiped it off, he's still in the building. The last time I was wrong, it was the drapery guys, but this time he actually left me a message. I'm not saying he wasn't in there, but I spoke to the manager, wasn't him. He was down in Maryland at his daughter's wedding or something. So is that all you're gonna do? There's nothing I can do at the moment, all right? But as soon as I get back, I'll file a report. You'll file a report? Get the landlord to change the locks immediately. Don't spend another night in there without fresh locks on the door. I'll be in touch. What exactly are you doing? Well, I will tell you what I'm not doing. I'm not waiting for the police. The police already know it's David. Yeah, but they said there's a chance his lawyer could get him off. All he has to do is raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. Yeah, but I mean, they found all that stuff in his apartment. Yeah, well, the only equipment they found was his telescope. No camera stuff, no recording stuff. Yeah, but what about the photos? I mean, the videos I mean, that should be enough. Well, they said that there's a remote possibility somebody planted that stuff. Yeah, who? Well, nobody, that's just what his lawyer's gonna tell the jury you know, I mean, they found most of that stuff after they arrested him when they came in with the search warrant, so I guess it's possible that somebody went in there. That's ridiculous. Yeah. That's our justice system for you. But I figure he's gotta keep his camera gear somewhere, so if we follow him long enough, we'll find out where. Is he there now? Yeah. He's watching television. Probably one of his pornos. It's a good thing the police gave you the tapes. Here. It's just such an incredible violation. I hope for his sake he's found guilty because if he gets off, I'm gonna go after him myself. Look at this. What? Look at that picture. What picture? That picture on the wall. What about it? It's that picture right there and you can't see that from the window. Get the lights. No, no, no, don't answer. He doesn't want you to be here. He probably already knows that I'm here. What do you want? Yeah. Just a second. Who is it? Justine Jamisen. Justine? Yeah, there was definitely a camera in here. But it ain't here now. Yeah, and the rest of the place is clean too. I mean, there's nothing in the other vents or smoke alarms. I mean, we've seen these things hidden in smoke alarms, coffee cans, you name it. The guy's totally sick. Sick, but smart. And if he was smart enough to take that camera out there, we're not gonna find any fingerprints either. Yeah, but... My fingerprints are gonna be all over that vent. Well, anybody besides the building manager have access to your unit? Yeah, it's not that we're rulin' out the manager. I mean, he would have access to both the apartments, yours and David's. So, are you saying that you don't think it was David? Well, no, it's... No, we think he's still good for it. It's just that we're covering our bases. Because once it gets to court these things are never a slam dunk. Justine. Hi, I'm Celeste, um... I came alone just like you told me to. Yeah. As far as you know. It started with the phone calls. Then the stalking. Why didn't you call the police? He threatened me. I kept thinking he'd go away, didn't really think he'd do anything. What did he do? He killed my fiance. They said it was an accident. But, he went up on the roof all the time. We had a garden there. He didn't fall. I have no memory of how he got to me. I never saw him. I just remember waking up and seeing the fire. What fire? There was an abandoned building half a block from The Sommer. He must have taken me there. By the time I woke up, he was gone. I think he just set the place on fire and left. The whole building went up. They said it was a miracle I survived. So what set him off was your fiance, he was jealous. No. He solved that by pushing him off the roof. What set him off was my trying to leave The Sommer. The cage, he called it. The day I moved out. That's when he crawled out from under his rock. Hi.. It's okay. So, I told you I wouldn't tell anybody what you did for me and I didn't. We both know who's been watching me. He's back. I know. Came out of your building about 20 minutes ago. The Sommer? He has a key? Some of the tenants here rent storage lockers in the basement. Can we find out? I suppose. He's not still there, is he? No, he... He took off in a cab. I think he's done this before. But the cops said that even with all the evidence, there's a chance that his lawyer will be able to get him off. Yeah, I know, yeah. They talked to me about that. Who did? The detectives. Asked me where I was such and such, when, and... They're just trying to build a case, that's all. Yeah. I was wondering since he's back, could you just keep an eye on him for me? Please. I suppose. Thanks. Celeste? Are you there, Celeste? It's me. Hey. What's up with the lock? I changed the locks, I'm sorry. Hi. Hey. You're kind of a good dancer. I don't know, I never saw myself dance. Would you like to? What do you mean? Watch, sit down. Wow! Pretty amazing? I went to this store over in Times Square, I got this little camera that you can hide anywhere. And there's a motion detector that turns the VCR on, if there's any movement in the room, the image sucks, but it's pretty cool? Watching the watcher. Exactly. Okay. What are you doing? I'm going to make him jealous. See, I hope that he saw you come into the building. I'm hoping that he sees us right now. And I hope that he sees us leave together. I think this bothers him. I thought it was you, you know? That's what I heard. I thought you were trying to scare me into moving back. Is that why you're here? What do you mean? Because you're scared. I'm scared for you, he gave me 24 hours. Wanna get rid of me? I'm not gonna get rid of you and you know this is very hard for me to admit but, um, I've missed you, I think I'll keep you forever. So, does that mean you're gonna move back? God. Easy, don't be so clingy. Hi. I didn't hear you go out. What's wrong? You probably didn't hear this either. He knows where you live. I've only been gone 20 minutes. You can't stay here alone. He's not gonna break in here. No, you can't stay here, all right? He's killed before. I'll only be here till 9:30. I, um, I have a rehearsal at 10:00. When can we check that tape? Um... I'll stop by there with Tasha and I'll call you if there's anything on it. Okay. My God. I think I got him. ""If you ""leave your cage, ""I will open this one."" That's sick. Don't. Calling the police. I don't wanna call the police. What are you gonna do? He just told me everything that I need to know. What? His camera's back. So, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna leave the cage. That should get him to come after me. What do you want me to do with the stuff in the fridge? I'll do that last, what time do you have to leave? I should be there by 4:00. Then you should go. We should both go. Yeah, I just want to finish up here first, but... Don't worry. What time you want me to be back here for you? I'll come by your place when I'm finished up here, probably around 9:00. I should be there by then. Be careful. You too. Derrek. Yeah, he's still upstairs. Yeah, I know. Look, I'm trying to keep an eye on him and pack at the same time. I was wondering if you could just call me if he goes anywhere? Okay. The minute he leaves? All right. All right. Um, I'll be in my apartment till around 9:00. All right.Okay. Ma'am. What's your phone number? 555-0155. Hello. Yeah, he... He just left. He's still out front. Thanks. I lost him. All right, well. Look, I think I found something that can help you. What? You gotta promise you're not gonna tell anybody who showed this to you, okay? Yeah, I promise. I'd lose my job. You're not gonna lose your job, just show me. It's in your building. This way. What's down there? It's just the storage area. That's where he keeps his stuff. You gotta remember what you promised, okay? I'll remember. Okay. It's right through here. It's number nine. It's right down here. My God. Yeah, I was wondering why he was coming down here all the time. The equipment. I have to call the police. Sorry. Thanks. Yeah. That way. The stairs were that way. We're not going that way. Why not? That way is better. Help! Help! Nobody can hear you down here, anyway. Why don't you put that away before you hurt yourself? Derrek, I'm warning you. Don't come any closer. Come on. Come on. You don't have the guts to use it. You see? I told you, you didn't have the guts. Rise and shine. There you go. A bird in the cage is worth two in the basement. Why are you doing this? You all ask the same, stupid question. All three of you. And the first time, I tried to answer it. I really did. But the second time, it just made me angry, because I couldn't answer it. It's really quite simple. I'm bored stupid. I sit behind that desk every day. With nothing to do but take in the mail. And wander around this building. But you're guarding the building. I'm guarding all the rich people. Do you know how boring that is? So, I like to amuse myself by keeping track of who's in and who's not. You know, who's on vacation and business trips. And when I make my rounds, I sneak into their apartments. I like to keep track of who has the best gear for spying on their neighbors. But I use all my own cameras. So, all that stuff in David's locker... It's mine. And later today, I'll probably put something of yours in there. Maybe your purse. A chunk of your hair. Maybe a finger. But David was your idea. You took me there. Told me you were gonna call the police. I thought to myself, ""Now here, is an opportunity ""I can't pass up."" So, I planted a few tidbits in his apartment. And then, after he got arrested, I brought out the big guns, so to speak. David's only mistake was buying that telescope. That, and his rather large collection of dirty movies. Well, that didn't help his case. Celeste! Celeste! I know you're down here. Celeste! You make a sound, and I'll kill him. Celeste, where are you? Can I help you, sir? Yeah, where's Celeste? Who? The woman you came down with. Miss Timmerman, she's... She's right through here. Brent! Think your boyfriend can help you now? Derrek, stop! We were setting a trap for David. Well, looks like that wasn't a good idea. Celeste thought if she tried to move out, he would come after her. So, I asked Brent to wait outside and he was watching as I followed him down the street and he watched me as I came back. So, that's how you knew she was in the basement? When I saw him bringing her down there, and when she didn't come out, I was just trying to help her. Well, when she didn't come out is when you should have called us. Of course, we're happy we got the right guy, so... It's all good. Thank you. All right, take care. Let's go some place real, like... Paris or maybe Italy. I will take you anywhere you want, baby.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/View_of_Terror-368075

Alright then, your gonna have to trust him to me.. I need him, he's been there, he knows what we are lookin' for. - I'm goin' with you, Jim. - I Don't need anybody else. Oh get off your antique manors Hill, I'm a profesional scientist. Let's go. This is where we first saw them. Well, look at this. Let's see... She knows alot more than she is lettin' on. What do you supposed she's after now? Seeing, if they left any visiting cards, I guess. They've definitely been here alright. You would'nt be kidding me now would ya'? You think there are anymore of those creatures around here? I thought I heard something under there. I said, I thought I heard something. The attack pattern that you described, is that of a nocturnal predator, Which probably means that it will keep to himself during the day, unless the territory is threatened. - Is this is there home territory? - I'm Not sure. We found evidence that they were here last night, but that does'nt mean but that does'nt mean nothing. If your right about they're size, the upstream food supply won't support them, they'ed probably move to the ocean. You seem damn sure of yourself. I have to be with men like you around. Come on. Let's get out of here. Like this? That's pretty close but this head is much bigger. They must have developed more than I figured. And maybe more intelligent. Johnny, take it. Ah, damn, It's a salmon. First time I ever thought I would be disappointed in seeing a fish. Think of it this way: If we're finding salmon of this size here, We can't be to far from finding what we are looking for. I just talked to my wife on the radio. Doctor say my brother gonna be alright. Good have they talked to him yet? No he's, still unconscious. But his vital signs are strong. How much do you know your not tellin' Drake? Will you put those damn binoculars down for a minute If You've seen what I seen. You say you're intelligent, your surprised by the size their jaws. Outside of that, you seem to think your sketch is pretty accurate. - The coastline, Jim. - What about it? they're Seems to be caves out there. Where do they lead to? There's your evidence. Your nuts! No don't shoot them, not yet. No! Now, shoot! Are you alright? That's twice I owe you my life. Oh, my God. Who is it? My God, it's Peggy. She's still alive. Let's get her outta here. What the hell are these things, anyway? First, as far as I can tell. The species has only just appeard. So there has to be a reason that a humanoid creature, evolved so quickly. - Note the gills on the side of the head? - Yeah, like a fish. They do pretty well out on the land. Yes, as far as we can tell. But thier natural habitat is clearly, the water. Though I guess think there in the process of becoming amphibious. Look at the size of the cranium. That means they have a tremendous brain capacity. Does not mean though, that they have the ability to use it all. Look. webbed hands. Why don't you gentlemen go on back to Noyo? We'll let you know what we find. Forget it. We're not leaving until we get some answers. - Don't worry. - Mr. Borden strongly suggest, that we keep this quiet until Canco has had a chance to, review it. Your theory could be totally incorrect. What the hell are you talking about? I've been trying to tell you people about this for a long time and you push it aside. Well look at it, Edwards! I'ts right in front of you! You stupid! Ass, Look at it! And you still say my theory is incorrect? My theory is not incorrect and I'm not gonna keep quiet any longer. And these people have the right to know. And I'm gonna tell them. A string of DNA film 232 in the conference room. Now, Edwards! DNA-5 is a growth gene. What your seeing here is a film of our early DNA-5 experiments with frogs. These are tadpoles in the larval stage. Nornlly tadpoles take 12 weeks to become adult frogs. Now we apply DNA-5, which carries genetic information, That stimulates the growth hormone in frogs. With the aid of DNA-5, adult hood is reached in a matter of days. So what's the point? We were duplicateing this process to accelerate the growth of salmon. When heavy tidal surges tore apart one of our experimental traps. 3000-DNA treated salmon escaped into the ocean. I wanted to notify the authorities, but my employer in canco Stopped me. What if the other fish are salmon? Exactly. It's my theory that feeding on the DNA-5 treated salmon, may have brought about evolution in more primitive fish like coelacanth, which was discovered in this area a few years ago by a local marine biologist. What the heck is a coelacanth? It's a prehistoric type of fish. Which has evolved in millions of years. But may have feeding on salmon containing DNA-5. I took these in the tunnel this morning. In one lifetime, this creature seems to have evolved to four growth stages. Starts out as a fish, but is humanoid in it's final stage. Why are they attacking us? Well, most bright animals, protect thier territory and their food sources. Maybe be intelligent enough to to perceive the man as a competitor. Why the girl? My theory is that these creatures are driven to mate man now. to further develope their incredible evolution. It's enough to scare the hell outta' me. But will people in the town believe us? Jake. The festival. Oh, my God. This is Mad Man Mike Michaels broadcasting live from the big Salmon Fest. We down here at the KFISH Radio the big fish. And here's my favorite little billboard Kitty, Ah how ya' doin' Kitty. Listen, she's gonna be down on the north end of the midway If catch her, you'll win a free visor. Alright!

I'm a personal trainer and Miss Orange County finalist. - This is my TEC-9. - That there is a TEC-9. Little cheap-ass spray gun made outta South Miami. It retail for 380, I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800. They advertise this TEC-9 as the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that shit?. It actually says that in the booklet that comes with it. ""The most popular gun in American crime."" Like they're proud of that shit. [Sidney] I love my TEC-9. Let me run this up. - Design emphasis behind this weapon. - Check out this gun here. This here is a Styer Aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen. [ Imitating Machine Gun Fire ] Ooh! That shit's expensive too, man. Made in Austria. My customers don't know shit about it, so there ain't no demand for it. Baby, I really could use me some more ice. Hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me tell you, though, man. You put this bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out there want one. I'm serious as a heart attack. When them Hong Kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45. And they ain't want one, they want two, 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer. But what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem. Now, I try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimeter... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems. But you know how them niggers is out there. You can't tell 'em shit. They want a.45. The killer had a .45, they want a .45. - Thanks, baby. - Mm-hmm. - Who's your partner?. - Cat named Mr. Walker. Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico. I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway. Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now that motherfucker rollin ' in cash. Got hisself a yacht with all kind of high-tech navigational shit on it. Oh, uh-uh-uh, here we go. AK-47, the very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitutes. Nothing gets between me and my AK. This here is the Chinese model. - I get 'em for 850 and double my money. -[Phone Ringing] Grab that for me, would ya, baby?. - You know it's for you. -[Ringing Continues ] Girl, don't make me put my foot in your ass.

He ain't any more of a gun expert than I am. - You want?. - Sure. [Woman On Video] It shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket, 9-millimeter Luger at 1,270 feet per second. At ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun. Demi Moore. Really reduce muzzle lights during firing.

Four years?. - For what?. - Bank robbery. Really?. -[Man On Phone ]Ah-iight. Later. - Shit, I'm impressed. Ha-ha. See what I'm talking about?. Now, that was about a man in New York... wants a 9-milimeter Smith and Wesson, model 5946. And why does he want it?. 'Cause it's the same gun that nigger on New York Undercover uses. 'Cause of that nigger, I'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger. So-- [ Clears Throat ] What's your cost?. Low as two. - You're serious?. - [ Chuckles ] I'm telling you, Louis.

Do yourself a really big favor and be there when I get there. How can I help you? Where can I put my ash?. Use that cup there, if you like.

Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down South out here. If he runs, and I have to go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses. You think you can do that?. I've done it. What's his full name?. Beaumont. That's all I know. Would you say that Beaumont is his first or his last name?.

They ain't got room in the joint for all these niggers out here killing people now. How they gonna find room for you?. That ain't what they're telling me. That's why they call it ""fuckin' with you."" Now, let me tell you how we're going to retaliate. All right?. Tomorrow I'm gonna pick you up, take you over to Century City, introduce you to my lawyer. Let me tell you something about my lawyer. This brother's name is Stacin Goins. This nigger is a junkyard dog. He my own personal Johnny Cochran. Matter of fact, he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass. And like Johnny Cochran, this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man. He live to fuck with the police. Now, as a favor, I had him look at your case. He say you ain't got shit to worry about.

Mm-hmm. - Come on in, man, and let's celebrate. - No, no. Uh-uh. Look here, I'm really supposed to be somewhere. Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping you could come run with me. What you mean?. You know, man, I hate to be the kind of nigger that do a nigger a favor, then bam-- hit the nigger up for a favor in return, but I gots to be that kind of nigger. - What?. What you want?. - I need a favor, nigger. - That requires me to go out tonight?. -Just a bit. Aw, man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place tonight. It is late as hell, man. I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on. Uh-huh. And why are you home, huh?. You home because I spent $10,000 to get your ass home. Now, look, I got a little problem, all right?. I need some help, and you can help me out. Go in the house and throw some shit on. Let's walk out to the car. Come on. I'm ready, man. What's your problem?. There ain't no problem. It's more like a situation. You remember them three M-60 machine guns I sold last year outta the five I got?. - Yeah. - Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. There's this group of Koreans over in Korea town startin' this little Neighborhood Watch thing. They need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business. Now, I'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?. The problem is, I ain't never done business with these Koreans before. I ain't worried, 'cause by and large Asians are very dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue with them about price and shit, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me a rule. Never do business with people you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you. Backup. Look, all you've got to do is lay in here and hold on to this motherfucker. All right?. I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods. When I open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker. Man, fuck that shit. I ain't for shootin' nobody. I ain't said nothin' about you shootin' nobody. All you gotta do is hold on to it. They'll get the idea. You must be out of your mind if you think I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk. We ain't goin' nowhere but to Korea town, man. You ain't gonna be in here no more than ten minutes. I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute. Why can't I ride up front with you?. You can't ride up front with me. The surprise element is 90% of it. I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gettin' in no goddamn trunk. - I can't believe you'd do me like this. - Do you like what, man?. I just ain't climbing in no goddamn, dirty-ass trunk, man. I got a problem with small places. I got a problem with spending $10,000 on ungrateful niggers to get them out of jail, but I did it. How small was that jail cell, motherfucker?. - I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up. - Then get your ass in this trunk. I want to help you, but I won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car. You think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass, huh?. - I know you helped me out. - Do you think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass?. - Yes or no?. - Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?. That's the only way I could help you, right?. So that's what I did. Now, look, man, all I'm asking you to do is get in the trunk, hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?. - You're catching a nigger off-guard with this shit. - Look here. I tell you what. When we get through fucking with these Koreans, me and you go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles on me. Think about it now. That 'Scoe's Special, smothered in gravy and onions, side of red beans and rice, some greens. That's some good eatin'. Man. [ Sighs ] Exactly how long do I gotta be in this motherfucker?.

I don't know. I'm in the cozy confines of an Oldsmobile... parked right outside Simone's house. - Oh, you're outside?. - Yeah. - Come on in. - Ah, no, man. I already caught that show. I got some for-your-eyes-only shit to show you. Why don't you step outside?. [Siren Wailing In Distance ] - Who was that?. - That's Beaumont. Who's Beaumont?. A employee I had to let go. What'd he do?. He put hisself in a position where he was gonna have to do ten years in prison. That's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years. If you know that, then you know Beaumont's gonna do anything Beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years, includin' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass. Now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me, and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me. Now, Louis, if you gonna come in on this thing with me, you've got to be prepared... - to go all the way. - [ Clears Throat ] Now, I got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in Cabo San Lucas. I make this delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?. You best think again. Before I let that happen, I'll shoot this nigger in the head... and ten niggers look just like him. You understand what I'm saying?. Yeah. - Sowe on the same page then?. -Yeah, I follow. My nigger. [ Chuckles ] [Airplane Engines Roaring] [Man ] Miss Brown! Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas, L.A.P.D. - Can I ask what you have in that bag?. - The usual stuff. You know, I'm a flight attendant for Cabo Air. - Can I help out here?. - Who's this?. Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicollet with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. - Oh, yeah?. May I see some I.D.?. - Yeah. Sure. Would you mind if we just took a look in that bag?. Do I mind?. Do I have a choice?. - Yeah. You have the right to say no. - No. I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. If I don't want to go to all that trouble, I'd just take you in on suspicion now. - Suspicion of what?. - Uh, could I say something?. He just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute. I'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything. - Go ahead. - Thanks a lot. [Groaning] Bad knees. You have a good flight?. It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went down there one time with Susan, my wife. Fuckin' turbulence was unbelievable. Hey, can I look in this envelope?. Ah. [ Wolf Whistle ] [ Laughs ] Goddamn. I'd say there's about, oh, uh, $50,000 here. What would you say, Ray? Looks like about 50,000 from here. - Is this your money?. - What if I say no?. You should know if you bring in anything over 1 0,000, you have to declare it. You forget, or what?. You can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison. You want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to Customs?. - I'm not sayin' another word. -Jackie-- I hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie. Those guys down in Customs?. They're a bunch of pricks. Excuse me, but they are. There's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with. You can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings, or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like Mark and myself. It's up to you. [Dargas ] Let's take a look here at the file on Jacqueline Brown. According to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law. In 1985, while a stewardess for Delta, you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot? That pilot was my husband, and I got off. You mean they offered you a deal, and you grabbed it. - He did time, you did probation. - [ Siren Wails ] I didn't hear you ask permission to smoke in my office. - May I smoke?. - No, you may not. So you get off with a slap on the wrist, but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines. Cut to 1 3 years later, you're 44 years of age, flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin 'piece of shit Mexican airline there is, where you make what-- $ 1 3, 000 a year? I make 1 6, 000, plus benefits. You been in the service industry 19 years, and all you make is 16,000, plus benefits? Didn't exactly set the world on fire, did you, Jackie?. Jackie, you have a good lawyer?. [Dargas ] Can she afford a good one, is more like it. Otherwise you'll be in Sybil Brand three weeks... before the public defender gets around to ya. - [ Siren Wails ] - Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?. Yeah?. No?. - [Pours Coffee ] - Because he knows you. Well, he knew you. He doesn't know anybody now. He's dead. They found him in a trunk of a car this morning, shot twice. Once in the chest, once in the head. Here you go. So I guess I'm wondering. If you don't know Beaumont, why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?. [ Clears Throat] Look, Miss Brown, we don't give a fuck about you. You know who we want. If you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this. If you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now, we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court. With your prior, the judge will give you two years. Now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change, but if I was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job I was fortunate enough to get, I don't think that I'd think I had a year to throw away. So let's start again now, shall we? Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who in America were you bringing it to? I 'm not sayin' another goddamn word. [ Clears Throat ] I 'd like your permission to look through this again so we'll know how much we're talking about. Sure. Go ahead. While we're at it, let's see what else is in there. Do you mind? Beauty case. - Mm-hmm. What's in it? - Beauty products. Alarm clock. Glass case. Birth control. - [ Dargas ] What's that? - My diet shit. Let's see what else is in there. Here. Here. Here. - What's this?. - What's that shit?. [Engine Revving] Let's go, ladies. First door on the left. [Woman ]♪ Ninety-nine years is a long, long, long time ♪ ♪ Ninety-nine years is such a long, long, long time ♪ ♪ Ninety-nine years is a long, long time ♪ ♪ Well, look at me ♪ ♪ I'll never be free ♪ ♪ I'm a long-time woman ♪♪ Brown, case 7 003 2. The charge is... possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute. - How does your client plead?. - Uh, Your Honor, she wishes to stand mute. Very well. Detective... Varga. - Dargas, Your Honor. - Sorry. Uh, you were the arresting officer in this case?. - That's correct, Your Honor. -And do you have a bail recommendation? - Yes, I do, Your Honor. - And that would be?. Based on the defendant's prior conviction... and the extreme possibility of flight due to the occupation, the state requests a bond of no less than 25,000. [Judge ] You people are fine with this? I'm gonna set bond at 1 0,000... and set the date of August 2 1... for the prelim. Your Honor, when will that be?. That's six weeks from now. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242. The charge is possession of a concealed weapon... and striking an officer. - How does your client plead? - I thought it'd be 2 5. [ Female Lawyer] Uh, my client would like to plead guilty, Your Honor. [Judge ] Is the arresting officer here in the courtroom? [ Toilet Flushing ] Uh-uh-uh. I didn't hear you wash your hands. - Comfortable?. - Yeah. - Door was open, so I just come on in. - I can see that. - Why?. - Got some more business for you. Oh, yeah?. What did he do?. She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at $1 0,000. Now, I'm figuring you could take that $1 0,000 you owe me from Beaumont, move it over to the stewardess. - The bond for possession's only a thousand. - Hmm. Yeah. Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin' that shit ""possession with intent."" A 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces, they calling that shit ""intent."" The same thing happen to a movie star, they call it ""possession."" Still sounds high. Well, um, she had on her, I believe it was 50 grand in cash. All right, before we start talking about stewardesses, Let's get Beaumont out of the way first. You know, I think somebody already did. - What?. - You ain't hear?. - Hear what?. - Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out. Oh, shit. That shit rhymes. Blew Beaumont's brains out. Police make contact with you?. Oh, hell, yeah. First motherfucking thing they did. You know, they see I pay a big money bond for my boy, they start thinking that ""where there's smoke there's fire"" logic. Rousted my ass out of bed 1 0:.00 in the morning. Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda. She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure. - This stewardess-- You know her last name?. - Mm-hmm. Brown. Jackie Brown. - What does she do for you?. - Who said she do anything for me?. She's my friend. My friends get in trouble, I like to help them out. Beaumont worked for you. This you and me talking, like lawyer-client thing?. You can't tell nothing I say to you?. You're not my client till you get busted and I bond you out. Well, we ain't got no, uh-- What you call that shit?. Confidentiality. Why should I tell you anything?. 'Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you 50 grand. And why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand?. Now you want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you. All right. You want another bond?. You want to move the 1 0,000 you got on Beaumont over to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I gotta get a death certificate, present it to the court, make out a receipt for return of bond collateral, I type up another application, - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - another indemnity agreement. - I haven't got time. - I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, - is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks. - I can do that. You know I got the money. I just ain't got it with me. Come back when you do. I'll bond out the stewardess. Look, you got to look at this with a little compassion, all right?. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kind of treatment. Gangsters don't give a fuck, but your average citizen, a couple of nights in County get to fuckin' with their mind. Ordell, this isn't a bar. You don't have a tab. Listen to me, all right?. You got a 44-year-old, gainfully employed black woman falsely accused-- Falsely accused?. She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?. Falsely accused of ""intent."" If she had that shit-- and mind you, I'm saying if-- that was her own personal shit to get high with. Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?. Oh, it's like that, huh?. All right. I got your little thousand bucks. - Hey, Candy. - Hey, Max. Dropping off Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown, Jackie. - Okay, no problem. You armed?. - You bet I am.

Can we just stop at a 7-Eleven or something?. - I thought you might like to have a drink. - I'd love to, but not there. How 'bout the Hilton by the airport?. - Is it dark?. - Kind of a sports bar. It doesn't sound dark. Why does it have to be dark?. Because it looks like I just got out of jail, that's why. You're dropping me off at my place. There's a joint near me. [Metallic Rattling] [Metal Ball Rattling] No, thanks. I quit three years ago. - Gain weight?. - Ten pounds. - Take it off and put it back on. - [ Scoffs ] That's why I don't quit. Mm. If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent. You know, the other day I figured out that I must have written about... 1 5,000 bonds since I've been in the business. I figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, I could help you figure out your options. So far, they told me if I cooperate, then I'll get probation, maybe. Or if I stand mute, I can get as much as five years. Does that sound right?. I'd say that if they try you and convict you, you won't get more than a year and a day. That's state time, prison. But they won't want to do that. They'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation. Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?. Yeah. But that's not what this is about. They were waiting for my ass. They knew about the money. - They even knew the exact amount. - What did they want to know?. Who gave me the money and who I was givin' it to. They found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off. They said it was him who told them about me. That would be... Beaumont Livingston. How do you know about him?. I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday. Ordell pick up his bond?. Same as you-- $1 0,000.

That's your business. - It wasn't mine. - What?. Oh, shit. [ Chuckles ] I bet that was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie. Yeah. If you didn't put it in there, he must have. Damn. That shit wasn't called for. Baby, I'm sorry. Bet they asked you a whole shit load of questions about it, huh?. And all that money, where it came from. Probably asked you who you was bringing' it to too. They asked. And you said?. - ""I want to talk to my lawyer."" - [ Laughs ] You sure you didn't get nervous and kind of let somethin' slip?. I mean, if you did, I ain't mad at you. I just gotta know. You ain't asking the right questions. You should be asking why they picked me up. They were waiting for me. They knew about the money and they knew the exact amount. - [ Lighter Clicks ] - They tell you how they happen to come by this information? Hmm. [ Exhales ] Beaumont Livingston? I knew it. I knew it. They even asked me if I knew Mr. Walker. Yeah?. I didn't tell them anything about him. My name come up? Mm-mm. - You ain't said nothin' about me? - Mm-mm. Ah, that's mighty noble of you. They tell you what happened to this Beaumont fellow? Yeah, they told me. Yeah. Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont. Or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time. Yeah, I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you ain't givin' them no kind of answer? - Mm-mm. - You scared of me? You got any reason to be nervous around me? [ Gun Hammer Cocks ] Is that what I think it is?. What do you think it is? - I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick. - Well, you thought right. Now, take your hands from around my throat, nigger. -What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?. -Shut the fuck up. Don't you move. Oh, what is this? What the fuck is this? Hey, that ain't got nothing to do with you. I carry that all the time. You been talking to them police too much. - The police didn't try and strangle my ass. - Come on, girl. - I was just playing with you. - I ain't playing with you. I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don't do what I tell you to do. - You understand what I'm saying? -Jackie, stop acting crazy. - Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying? - Yeah, woman. Damn! Now, sit your ass down on that sofa. See? Police start fuckin' with your mind, start pittin' black against black. - That's how they do. They been doing this since-- - Shut your raggedy ass up. Sit the fuck down! - [ Sighs ] - And put your hands behind your head. - This is gettin' silly now. - Oh, silly?. You want to see some motherfuckin' silly? If I have to tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up. - I just came over here to talk to you. - To talk?. The way I see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about. One thing, and that's what you are wiling to do for me. - I can get you a lawyer. - No, let's be realistic. Now, sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. - That's why you came here to kill me. - I ain't come over to kill you. No, that's all right. It's okay. Now, I forgive you. Now, let's say, if I tell on you, I walk. - If I don't, I'll go to jail. - Uh-huh. I want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if I'm convicted up to a year or put on probation. Now, if I have to do more than a year, you pay another $100,000. I can do that. - You know I got that problem. All my money is-- - In Mexico. - Right. - Well, I been thinking about that too. I got me an idea. Uh-- Let me hear that. We friends again. Why don't you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else? - I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on. - All right. [Door Tapper Knocking] You want your gun back?

I know more now about Ordell's money. Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. I know, but it's a lot of money. It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo, and more coming in. - How'd you find that out? - Ordell told me last night. - He called?. - He came by. - What'd you do? - We talked. Do you think he still trusts you?. He had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me. And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can. - Why? - Because he needs my ass. Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over there in Cabo. You want some sugar? No, thank you. There's gotta be other ways of getting it out. Maybe, but I'm the only one he's ever used. I mean, he can't use his other people. They're crooks. I mean, he might try to... bring the money in himself, but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines. So, either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me. And I made him feel like he still can. Are you gonna offer to set him up? Yeah, if I get off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

It started falling out, so I did something about it. How'd you feel about that? I feel fine with it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it. I did it to feel better about myself, and, you know, I do.

See, I get high at night when I get through with all my business. - ♪♪ [Theme Music On TV] - That Rutger Hauer? No, it's Helmut Berger. Hmm. - Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl?. - Okay. - You know, I hope you don't mind hanging out with Louis. - No problem. Try not to tear his clothes off of him, all right?. They're new. - Ha, ha, ha! - Ha, ha! [ Kisses ] - Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man. - Okay. Later. - Want a Metrix?. - [ Coughs ] Uh-- Damn. Shit. What's a Metrix?. [ Coughs ] It's like this major meal that you drink in a shake instead of having a big meal. - It's like a diet thing? - No. It's what bodybuilders drink to, you know, beef up. No, thanks. [ Coughing ] Okay. When was the last time I saw you? Oh... six, seven years ago. It doesn't seem like that long ago. - It was that long ago. - [ Men On TV Shouting ] - How old were you in this picture? - Which one? The roller disco picture. This one. Oh. Um, 14. - You were 14 here? - Yup. Shit, man. I thought you were at least 16. Well, I'm about the same height now as I was then. [Man On TV] Bruno! Sanchez!

Were you in L.A. then? - No. - Where were you? I was in Detroit. With Ordell? Yeah. We had done some time already. Oh. Were you a... disco guy?. Nah. - Come on. Don't lie. - No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance. - Were you ever in one? - I went to a few just to meet women, but... it was so loud and I didn't like to dance. During that whole scene, I just drank in bars usually. So who didn't make the cut? - That's a picture of me in Japan. - Whose arm is that? Uh, that's the guy that I lived with. His name was Hi-Hiro-- Hiro-- Hiroshi. - He must have made quite an impression. - [ Laughs ] If you count cheese. I never got to know him really. You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese, and his English was terrible. But what am I going to say? His English was better than my Japanese, you know. - That sounds like a problem. - Not really. You know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway. I never really got to know him, but I knew enough to know... that I wasn't missing much, so-- Anyway, I keep that picture because, of all the fucking time I was there, that's the only picture I've got of me in Japan. - That's Japan. - Oh. Yeah. Well-- Yeah, I can-- Yeah, it looks-- I could tell. Wanna fuck? Yeah. [Heavy Breathing] [ Panting ] That was fun. Yeah. Yeah, that really hit the spot. [ Sighs ] Now we can catch up. Yeah.

What the fuck that got to do with anything? They know I'm delivering for you. I told 'em about the half mil. They could give a fuck about it. All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns. So I said, ""Look, you want proof he's getting paid for selling 'em? - Let me bring in the money."" -And they said? - Yes. - [ Grunts ] Hey, what's the matter? I mean, that's what we discussed last night. This is just seeming kind of risky now, you know. Fuck this. Now, let me lay it all out to you, okay? I make two deliveries-- the first with 10,000. You know, like a dry run? They watch it, see how it works. Then the second delivery, I come home with the half mil. Mm-mm, mm-mm. See, that's too much exposure. - Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money. - You don't have to. I told them you never pick up the money yourself. - You always send someone, and I never know who it is. - Mm. - That's a good idea. - If you listen, it's a damn good idea. Now, the first time I do it, they're looking around, they see me hand the 10,000 to someone. - Who? - I don't know. A friend of yours. - Like a woman? - If you want. Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking a woman. Wait a minute. If they're gonna let you go, - how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time? - 'Cause I don't trust 'em. Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils, it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before. - But you don't?. - No. I hand it to someone else first. Hmm. And they follow the wrong one, thinking she's bringing the money to me. - That's the idea. - So, we gonna need two women. - Can you cover that?. - Yeah. Yeah, I got the women covered. Where are you planning on puling this off?. The Dell Amo Mal, the food court. And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?. It's my plan. We're in this together. Yeah, but it's my money and I don't need no fuckin' partners. I ain't your partner. I'm your manager. And I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do it all under the nose of the cops. So, therefore, I'm your manager, and a manager gets 1 5%. - No, a manager gets ten percent. - No, that's an agent. - I'm gonna give you ten. - No. No. A manager gets 1 5%, agent gets 1 0. I'm getting 1 5%, all right?. All I'm gonna give you is ten. And the same deal as before. I can do that. So he says, ""Fuck that, "" and moves over into guns. See, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit. He's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers. Well, he seems to be making out. - Is it dead?. - Yeah. Yeah, well... so far, he is. But you got to admit, he's not too bright. Oh... I wouldn't go so far as to say that. He moves his lips when he reads. What does that tell you?. Let's say that he's streetwise, you know. We'll give him that. He's still a fuckup. [ Water Gurgling ] He killed a man who worked for him the other day. - Well-- - [ Gurgling ] So, what are you trying to tell me?. That I should get out of here?. That's not what I'm saying at al. You know where he went?. He went to go meet that stewardess. - Does that bother you?. - Please! Well, I don't know. You live with him, so-- No, I live here. He just drops in and out. Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico?. - Uh-huh. - Of course he did. He tells anybody who’s gonna listen. Well, that's what him and that stewardess are doing.

Has he hinted around?. No. He just tries to act cool. You know, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. He's just a young guy having fun being a cop. I know the type. Trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than he is in the money. If he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction, but he wouldn't walk off with the money:, it's evidence. - And what about you, Max?. - What?.

When did you decide?. It's been a long time coming, but I finally made up my mind. I guess it was... Thursday. - [Gate Buzzes] - Miss Brown?. - Yes?. - I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun, got another gun and the stun gun, went to this guy's house in Ell Monte and waited for him to come home. - What do you do when he comes home?. - Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, you cuff him and take him to County. - You do that?. - It's my job. - Did you do that that night?. - Well, the guy never came home. But I'm sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun. The whole house smells of cat pee. And after a couple of hours, I think, ""What am I doing this?. It's 1 9 years of this shit."" And I make up my mind. That's it. I'm not sure you answered my question, Max. Which one?. If you had the chance, unemployed now, to walk away with a half million dollars, would you take it?.

Ordell feels way too hot for him to bring in his money, and he knows you're watching him and he's fucking paranoid. - So he's sweating a little bit. - He's gonna keep his half mil where it is, but he's gonna bring in 50,000 just in case he needs bail. - It'll be more than that. - Don't be so literal.

She grabbed the bag. And then somebody fuckin' killed her for it. What happened to the bag she gave you?. She didn't give me a bag. Melanie was not a part of the plan. Ordell probably told her to do it. That's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off. But I couldn't go after her, because I was in my fucking underwear. And I had to put on this suit because I could put it on faster than my uniform-- - You had time to pay the sales chick. - I had to. Ray, I was frantic. What was I supposed to do?.

When Vada's father hires Shelly, a makeup expert, and begins to fall in love, Vada is outraged and does everything in her power to split them up.","I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids, and I've learned to live with this chicken bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years. So I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. Dad, I don't want to upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing, cancer. I'm dying. Okay. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge. All right. Who's in? Raise your hand. Are you coming or not, Thomas J? I don't think so. I knew he wouldn't come. I can't. I have to go home. Yeah, to play with his dolls. Leave him alone. Come on, let's go. Hey! You didn't pay me. How do I know you're gonna show us one? You're such a baby. All right. Here. Okay, follow me and don't say a word. You ready? You sure you want to see it? Or is someone going to go yellowbelly? I'm not chicken! Okay. Lean forward. It's empty. You're so weird. I want my money back. - I was afraid of this. - Of what? Well, sometimes when we get them, they're not completely dead. You know, like when they cut a chicken's head off and they still run around crazy. You're full of shit. I bet she's roaming around this house somewhere. There she is. In the rocking chair. Let's get out of here. Quick. Come on. Hurry up. Hi, Gramoo. Vada, would you bring down my cigarettes? See you later. Did I tell you he was my woodshop teacher? You took woodshop? Yeah, I made a tie rack. I made a tie rack. - Was it fancy? - Yeah. Vada, just put them on the stool. Daddy, guess what? I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday. Yeah. Rack holds six ties. I still have mine. Arthur! Vada! I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly yesterday. Good for you, baby. Once you put the hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, you're a shoo-in to win. I like to buy up all the railroads. Vada, we're trying to work here. Cruella De Vil stole all the puppies. She was going to make a fur out of them. Hand me the cannula. Vada. Dad? I'm embalming my high school teacher. Don't sing. All right, Arthur. Just slide him to me a little bit. That's it. That's good. Okay. Put him in a nice model c-501. Bronze, stainless Eternal Journey. Yeah, he'll look like a champion. Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in? Sure. Come on in. So, have you had the unfortunate experience of recently losing a loved one? Could I see your dad? Just for a second? Dad, somebody's here! He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. Prostate cancer. Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner. How may I help you? I'm Shelly DeVoto. We spoke the other day regarding the makeup artist job? Yes. It's still available, I hope? I think it's still available. I'm a licensed cosmetologist. I worked for two years at the Dino Raphael salon. All my customers cried when I told them I was leaving. - Miss DeVoto... - I have a wonderful disposition. I put people right at ease. Miss DeVoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a beauty parlor. It's a funeral parlor. They're dead? Yes, they are. Stiffs? Deceased. The ad just said makeup artist. Excuse me a second, will you? Sure. Hi, George. This is a 1258. I didn't want the burnished handles. - Is that your camper? - Yes, it is. That's really cool. Hello. She's shy. Just put it back in the display room, fellas. Okay, Harry. Daddy, how come that coffin's so small? They come in all sizes, honey, just like shoes. Is it for a child? Of course not. Then who's it for? Short people. Very short people. Excuse me. What about the job? Pardon? I need the job. You still want it, even though... Sure, it's no big deal. You see, all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive. So they have something in common. You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone. Okay, Mr. Sultenfuss. - You've got a deal. - Great. - You can start right away. - Okay. Call me Harry. Now... Is this what you'd normally wear for work or... - Look... - Don't get me wrong. I like it very much, but the... I promise I'll take good care of these people. They deserve it. They're dead. All they've got left is their looks. Hey, look at this. No feet. Wow, a real Evel Knievel. What the hell are you doing in my garage? Get out of here! Hi, Vada, what's wrong today? I'm very sick. Okay, take a seat. I'll check if the doctor can see you. Vada's here. She says she's very sick. She looks all right to me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He'll see you. Why don't you go in? Well, what is it? I can handle it. You are perfectly healthy. That can't be. I have all the classic symptoms. Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today? Yes. Vada, you've got to stop this. There's absolutely nothing wrong with you. I'll just have to get a second opinion. So what did he say was wrong with you? The whole medical profession is a crock. Hey, wait up for me. - Hey, look. - At what? That's Mr. Bixler. Let's go talk to him. I don't want to talk to no teacher. It's summer. Hi, Mr. Bixler. Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J. - How's the summer treating you? - It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading. Really? Already? The summer's just begun. Yes, and now I'm reading War and Peace for fun. No wonder you're my prize pupil. - What about you, Thomas J? - I haven't started yet. Better get on his case, Vada. Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house? Well, I just bought it. Now I'm fixing it up. This is one big house for one single person. Well, you never can tell. I might get a pet. How are you going to get the money to pay for this old house if you're not working? Well, I'm going to teach creative writing this summer. So, I'm doing some work. - How much does it cost? - $35. What do you get for that? Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. - This an interrogation, Vada? - No. Well, I guess I'll go home and finish off War and Peace. It's summer. You're kids. Go play. Want to go to Gray's orchard and pick some peaches? - No, I'm going home. - Why? It's not dinnertime yet. ""Dinnertime""? You're like a dog. You just go home to eat! Don't pee on the hydrant! Rupert Gwynn called. There was a big accident on PA-34. They're bringing in two tomorrow. Excuse me, Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's hair. He kinda looked... Harry, what's wrong with her? She's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli. I think it's my prostate. No. How many removals did you say we were expecting? Two. I'm gonna have to do a v-section on one. Can you give me a hand? Well, I guess so. If you want. Now this isn't gonna be a repeat of that smelter accident a few years ago, is it? Don't mock that. That's how we bought the new Cadillac. Yes, I know that. Except, I had a body in my bedroom, you had a body in your bedroom. We were littered with peoples' bodies. - Who's winning? - I am. Look. Vada and her little boyfriend. He is not my boyfriend. I bet she kisses him on the lips. Do you think I'd kiss that ugly old thing? Yeah, anyway. Come on, let's go. Judy's father owns the Bijou Theater, and we get to see all the movies for free. - Maybe you can come sometime. - Don't invite her. She'll have to bring her boyfriend. You know, Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you. I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating. Want a piece of chocolate? - Thomas J? - I'm allergic to it. - To chocolate? - He's allergic to everything. To chocolate? - To everything. - To everything. - That's a pretty ring you're wearing. - It's a mood ring. It tells what mood I'm in. It doesn't work. It always stays black. It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood. Maybe black means you're happy. I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get $35? She's crazy. She wants to go to school over the summer. It's not a real school. It's a writing class. I want to be a writer. She only wants to go because her sweetie pie's the teacher. Shut your big fat mouth! I think you'd make a fine writer. Did you ask your dad? He won't give it to me. Well, you don't know that. Ask him. Edith, what channel is Cronkite on? Channel 2, Archie, the one we don't watch 'cause you always say Walter Cronkite is a communist. I never said that, Edith. The man ain't all red. What's the matter with this? There ain't nothing coming on. I'll help you fix it, Daddy. Daddy, can I have $35? That's a lot of money for a little girl. It's for school. A summer writing class. Any more soda left? Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer. Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist. Dad? I love this guy. - Dad? - What? The money? Well, maybe next summer. He forgot about the time I wanted to be a magician. I was really great at making myself disappear. - Want to play? - No. I got to go to the cemetery. Keep your head up. Don't look at the ball. Look at me. See? You were looking at the ball. All right? Keep your head up. Give me some skin. All right. Please! Open the door! Please, someone, open the door! Please! Please! Open the door! Vada? What happened? My ball. I lost my ball. Come on, sweetie. Excuse me, Harry? - Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter? - Yeah. Didn't I give you a picture of what she looked like? Yeah. You don't like it? This was the Reverend Porter's wife. You have her looking like a two-dollar hooker. I think she looks nice. Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair... I'm sorry. - Nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972. - She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive. I just wanted to get past this old schoolmarm image. That wasn't an image. She was an old schoolmarm. Fix it. Harry. I was just wondering if there is anything wrong with Vada. What do you mean? - Well, the other night at dinner... - That. She just likes to play. I don't think so. I think she's confused about death. She was raised in a funeral home. She knows a thing or two about it. - But Harry, I really think... - She's a perfectly happy 11-year-old girl. Look, don't give me any advice about my daughter. Okay? There's Shelly. Hi. Can we look around in your camper? Sure. I'll give you the royal tour. Whoa. Gosh. Wow! This is the coolest thing. And you can really eat and sleep here? I'm going to drive us to Liverpool. ""Liverpool""? Big Ringo fan. Right. - Would you like a soda? - I would. - Thomas? - Yes, please. What are you reading? You shouldn't be looking at that. It's a little too old for you. Did you read all these books? What are they about? Mostly love and romance. Gross. They're just fun to read. Here. Cheers. Are you married? No. I'm divorced. Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced. I know. Sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other. The Meyers are divorced. Shelly, can I have a cookie? Hey, where are all the cookies? Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place. What are you saving for? Nothing in particular. Just putting it away for a rainy day. I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch. Thanks, Shelly. Bye. Well, Miss Vada, what do you say we head back? - Can I use your bathroom first? - Sure. You don't have to wait. Daddy will be mad if you're late. Okay. ""The great way is not difficult for those with no preferences. ""With the absence of both love and hate, ""everything becomes clear and undisguised."" That was written by a Chinese philosopher in the year 600. Now, why would I choose to bring that up in a creative writing class? Because the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality. In other words, I want you to listen to your classmates' writing with a clear and open heart. Okay? So, who's going to go first? I got one. Yeah. ""I sang a song for you to hear ""I painted a picture for you to see ""I picked a rose for you to smell ""I planted grass for you to touch ""But you did not hear my song ""You did not see my picture ""You did not smell my rose ""And you did not touch my grass."" Maybe she was out of town. That's not funny. His poem is about futility. We toil in unrewarded obscurity. Now, I hear judgment. Let's not forget the part about the open heart. Vada, is there something I can do for you? I paid the money. For this class? I want to be a writer. But Vada, this is a... This is an adult writing class. Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She wants to be a writer. More power to you, little sister. Vada, you sure you want to do this? Okay. Welcome to the class. Go find a seat. Okay. Who's next? I experienced something with my boyfriend the other day and I wrote a few words down. Floor's yours, Ronda. ""He covers me like a blanket ""From the cold, dark night ""As I look into his eyes, I know it's right ""To touch, to feel ""I know he's real ""Flesh, all a mesh ""Flesh, all a mesh ""I can't fight it ""There's no point ""I wake up and light a joint"" Vada. I wrote a poem, too. Please. Ode to Ice Cream by Vada Sultenfuss. ""I like ice cream a whole lot ""It tastes good when days are hot ""On a cone or in a dish This would be my only wish ""Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road Even with pie a la mode."" That's all I got so far. I hear that, Vada. ""Flesh all a mesh"" or ""rocky road,"" it's about desire. Vada, that's... It's very sweet and it rhymes and that's also good, but you're not expressing to me what's in your soul. I want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets. My fears and secrets: I'm afraid I killed my mother. Excuse me, Harry. I'm sorry. I just want to let you know the flowers were delivered and the room's all set up. Thanks. Listen, I want to apologize for the other day downstairs about Vada. I was a little harsh. I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada very much. After my wife died, Gramoo moved in here to help us take care of Vada. They were very close. But lately, as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kind of crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it, though. I'm sure she will. Nothing's biting today. Maybe they had a big breakfast. I'm going to be an acrobat when I grow up. Big deal. I can do that, too. Thomas J., you got something. No! Hurry. I'm trying. Reel it in. It's only a sunny. Throw it back. I don't like touching fish. I'm gonna pull the hook out without having to touch it. You're hurting him. Don't kill him. Darn hook. I'm bleeding. Did he get away? Go look. Yeah, he got away. Come on, let's go. We can become blood brothers. No, I don't want to. - You could pick that scab on your arm. - It's a mosquito bite. It will bleed. If I do it, can we go? Okay. Okay, rub them together. Now we're blood brothers for life. Hi. Hi. What can I do for you? Nothing. I was just wondering what you were doing. I'm just typing up a funeral notice. You know, when someone dies we put one in the paper, usually. It's a service we provide for the family. Right, right. ""Bader, Lorenzo. ""Died June 22, 1972. ""Devoted husband to Nicolette. ""Cherished father of Fabrizio and Heidi. ""In lieu of flowers please send donations to the Holy Name Society."" I wrote that. No kidding? It's good, ""in lieu of."" I love that word ""lieu."" I prefer it to ""instead."" It has more dignity. ""In lieu,"" ""instead""... No contest. It's no big deal. Harry, you have to learn how to take a compliment. Movies, movies... Love Story at the drive-in. I cried my eyes out. Did you see it? I haven't been to the movies in ages. I love to see movies. Especially at the drive-in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive-in. I'll let you get back to work. I do enjoy playing bingo. If you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church, you're welcome to. Okay. Hi, Vada. Are you going out somewhere? Nope. So how come you're putting lipstick on? A girl's always got to look her best. I think lipstick looks fake. No one's lips are that color. - Have you ever tried any? - No. Come here. Sit down. Go like this. A little less. Okay. All right. Now, first, we blot. Take a look. I think it looks real nice on you. Shelly, do you think I'm pretty? Yes, Vada, I think you're very pretty. You've got these great, big sparkling eyes the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth. The boys at school don't think I am. They'll come around. Close your eyes. I want to bring out the gorgeous color in them. Now, the first rule in applying eye makeup is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow. Do you like putting makeup on people? I've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the movie stars, but I haven't gotten there yet. All right. Open your eyes. Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that Hollywood thing. - Your lip bleeding? - No! What's wrong with your eyes? A girl can never wear enough eye shadow. Where's your bike? In the garage. Walk me over. It's only a garage. Come on. Hey, one of my streamers is gone. Probably fell off in here. Hey, look at this. That was Gramoo's. It's a phrenology chart. They used to study the bumps on your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, I'll diagnose your head. I don't want to. Come on, it's fun. - Interesting. - What? - You have no personality. - Hey, where does it say that? Never mind. Is that your dad? Yes. Who's that with your dad? That's my mother. - Do you remember her? - No. Gramoo said she's in heaven. - What do you think it's like? - What? Heaven. I think... Everybody gets their own white horse and all they do is ride them and eat marshmallows all day. And everybody's best friends with everybody else, and when you play sports there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last. But what if you're afraid to ride horses? It doesn't matter 'cause they're not regular horses. They got wings. And it's no big deal if you fall, 'cause you just land in a cloud. That doesn't sound so bad. Come on. We'll never find that streamer. Well, well, well. What's going on in here? Nothing. I'm dressing. You're dressing. Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. Don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother? Hey, watch the hair! - The shirt! - Give! All right! - I'm going out with Shelly. - Yes! Yes. That's great. That's great. - I'm very nervous. - Why? - The last date I had was 20 years ago. - That's true. Harry. Harry. Sit down. Let me fill you in on today's women. Since the last time you dated, something happened. The sexual revolution. Now, before that you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check. No more, no more. You want to know what else is missing? Bras. - Come on. - Harry, I'm serious. Trust me, Harry. This woman's lib thing is in. You got to treat her like every Tom, Dick and Harry. Are you sure about all this? Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer, huh? I'm running late. Shelly will be here any minute. She's picking you up. Good, you're on the right track. No, she's just driving over here. Then we're taking my car. How do I look? Like a Sultenfuss. Go get her. - Night, Vada. - Dad... Why are you dressed up to play bingo? I just want to look nice. You never cared before. Well, Shelly's coming over. We're going to go together. - Why? - She likes to play bingo. Can I go, too? No, I think you better stay here and keep Gramoo company. Kitty, looks like your hunch really paid off. Yeah, well, I'm glad. Though I got to admit I'd just as soon not have any more bounty prisoners coming through Dodge anytime soon. It's a bit wearing on the nerves. You know, this day was starting off just fine and I'm going to keep it that way. Doc, you never answered my question. Talk about wearing on the nerves... Vada? - Vada, where are you? - Here. Don't do that! Sorry. What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds out I'm out here. Let's go to the church. They're playing bingo tonight. I told you, I'd get in trouble. - Pacifist! - Am not. - Bed-wetter. - I stopped that. ""N-38."" Under the ""N,"" three, eight. Don't laugh, here's a strategy to bingo. For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds. When choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much more activity. Does it make it easier to win? No, just more activity. ""I-17."" Under the ""I,"" one, seven. Hi, Carl. Vern. They're not going to let us in, Vada. We're kids. We're not going to bet. We're just going to watch. Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo. Duck. ""N-4-2."" Under the ""N"", four, two. Great! - There's your dad and Shelly. - I don't want them to see me. 3-7. ""B-4."" Under the ""B,"" four. ""O-69."" Under the ""O,"" six, nine. - I just had a terrible thought, Harry. - What's that? I'm going to be putting makeup on some of these people very soon. Why do you think these seats were empty? ""B-6."" Under the ""B"", six. - Can we go yet? - Go. You know I'm not allowed out by myself after dark. - I'm just not lucky, Harry. - It's not always luck. I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers a guy with ten cards can win as easily as a guy with 100. Kind of like men. How do you mean? You can be in a room with 100 men and not like any of them. Or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want. ""B-1."" Under the B, one. Bingo! We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand? There was no bingo. It came from outside. - How could someone outside get a bingo? - Someone outside didn't get a bingo. Someone outside yelled ""bingo,"" you moron. - Who you calling a moron? - Put a lid on it, Vern. Put a lid on it? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ass! It's just a bingo game. We can go now. I had a good time tonight. I haven't had a bingo partner in ages. Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute. Okay, sure. - Home sweet home. - It's nice. I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. It certainly looks bigger than it seems. You can look in the bathroom, if you want. People are always curious about that. Like what happens when you flush? Yeah. Are you mad at me? No, why? I don't know. Tonight you just seemed a little cool. Not opening car doors and... That was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating '70s women. Look, I'm so out of touch. I haven't dated a woman in ages. Not since my wife died. What happened to her? Complications during childbirth. She died two days after Vada was born. Did she ever see Vada? I brought the baby into the room a couple of times. She opened her eyes. Yeah. Yeah, I think she saw Vada. It was... Well, did I ruin this? Dance with me. Here? This is where we are. Is there enough room? - I haven't danced... - In ages. I know. Me neither. Bra? See? You're not that out of touch. Phil, he's... You're good. At Whitman High, I was considered a pretty hot date. I did a killer frug. What are you wearing? Old Spice. Phil says it's a timeless classic. - So, do you want to? - ""Want to"" what? Kiss me. - Yes. - Good. Good at kissing and dancing. I'm very optimistic. I'd better go. It's only a clock. Good night, Shelly. Good night. Well, I guess it's official. We had a date. Maybe we can play bingo again sometime. I'm tired of bingo. Maybe we should try that drive-in of yours. Good night. Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. That's really cool. Okay, what we're going to do is send our vibes out into the group. Everybody hold hands and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths. Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling without speaking any words. Send out your vibe and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it? Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel? I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength. I can feel that Ronda is one with the earth. She's so cosmically in tune. So right on. That's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like you were full of inner peace and harmony. Vada, what did you feel? I felt Justin's hangnail. No, Vada. That's not what we're looking for. A hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul? Feel my aura. I don't think I'm allowed to. Tell you what. Let's try it again. Hold hands. Gramoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal cords. Ruined her singing voice. I don't think Gramoo thought it was insignificant. And some lettuce. Watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. Hey! I thought I recognized you two. - Hi, Vada. - Hi. - We were picking things up for the barbecue. - Yeah, me, too. Mind if I tag along? Not at all. - A lot of potatoes. - It's for Shelly's famous potato salad. I'm looking forward to that. Hey! Damn it! - Vada, watch what you're doing. - Sorry. You know, this is gonna be my first Fourth of July picnic. Really? Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes real bad? Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today. I need olives. I used to like my Ken and Barbie dolls. Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas, I got them a camper and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff. Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. - You've cremated them. - That's what I do. - You want to do it? - No, no, no. If you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes into little packages? Put out a product. Support me for a while. - How's it going, chef? - Okay. - I love your apron. - Thanks. - Are they ready yet? - No, sweetie, not yet. - When? - Soon, honey, soon. When? In a minute. Look, it's hot. Sweetie, you'll burn your nose. Look out. Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub. Yay, God. I'll second that. Hey, Shelly, like seafood? Why? See food. That's attractive. Shit! Excuse me. Hey, Shelly. Who lives here, The Addams Family? Danny, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? Hi, Ralph. - Danny, how did you find me? - You told everybody where you were going. - I'm here for the motor home. - No! These two people do not have a good relationship. I've been living in it for over a year. The camper is mine. Excuse me. ""Mutual asset."" That's what the lawyer said. It's supposed to be our mutual asset, not Shelly's recreational vehicle. - Give me the keys. - Keep your voice down... - Why? - My boss is watching us. I'm impressed. - God, I guess I have to introduce you now. - Yeah, all right. This is Harry, Phil, Gramoo and Vada Sultenfuss. Vada Sultenfuss? Tough break. I like my name. This is Danny and Ralph. They own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married. Are you here to take Shelly back? Nice to meet you. We got burgers and hot dogs here if you care to join us. - I can't stay. I'm here because my wife... - Ex! Ex. Ex. My ex-wife seems to have ripped off my camper. Shelly? Honestly, Harry, he got the Mustang. I promise... I don't think so. In fact, I've got a copy of the property settlement right here. Shit! This is my lease. Damn it, I keep forgetting things. I'm getting senile. - Danny? - What? Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you. But I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper. The trips you took, the sights you saw. Those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever. Is this guy boinking you? That's a real bonehead thing to say! Look, you're not going to take Shelly's camper. No? - It's her home. It's where she lives. - Oh, really? Okay, fine. Look, go cook. Give me the goddamn keys. - Stop that, that hurts! - Come on. Danny! What did you do that for? - Who are you? - I'm his brother. Then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often. Why? Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm going to bury him in my front yard. Your father's a savage. Bye, Ralph. Well, you were pretty great. Is it really your camper? Look! - Can you see them from the backyard? - You can get the general idea. Yeah, there they are. They always look the same every year. Look. Did you love him? I would never marry anybody I didn't love. He must like Shelly. I never saw him hit anyone in his life. He likes her. Does he love her? Probably. Do you like her? Yes, I do. - And I think she's very good for your father. - Why? After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny. Really? Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry. My dad was funny? Well, he wasn't one of the Marx Brothers, but he made me laugh. My uncle fought in the Korean War. He had a steel plate put in his head. Daddy said he didn't come back the same. One night we picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his teeth. It was really neat. - Can't you see it? - What? - Can't you see it? - No. It's there. Vada, there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat. Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours? So you fill it with water, like this, and what have you got? A water gun. - Cool! Can I get one for Vada? - Yes, yes. Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada ever tell you why she comes down here so much? 'Cause she's dying. - Do you think she is? - No. Why do you think she says that? Because she gets scared of all those dead people in her house. And you know that saying, ""Can't beat them, join them."" Well, if she's one of them, she won't be as scared. You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you. She's my best friend. Miss Vada, how are you feeling? As good as can be expected. Hey, Vada, guess what we got? - What? - This. Hey, you! I'm going to get you! I'll get you! Give me that, you creep! I just got you. No, you didn't. - Whoa. - What? - There's a beehive right there. - So? Stand back. Are you crazy? You'll get stung. You're right. Let's knock it down. - What do you want it for, anyway? - 'Cause they're neat. I got it. My mood ring. It fell off. I got to find it. They're alive! Run for your life! - Run faster! They're after us! - I am running faster! - Hurry! - Jump in the water! - But I have my clothes on! - Do it! - Vada, is that you? - Yes. Hey, guess what. We're going to the carnival tonight. Be ready to go in 10 minutes. Shelly's coming with us. - So, Vada, what's your favorite ride? - I like the freak show. I know, I know. Let's go on the sit-on-the-bench-and-rest ride. I don't think that the roller coaster agreed with your dad's stomach. You know, Vada, you have to watch what you eat here. I remember once I went to a carnival with my cousins, David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs and the next day they came down with nephritis. Nephritis is a kidney disease. - You don't get it from hot dogs. - Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science. They were in a magazine. They were! Popular Mechanics... No, Popular Science. I don't know. It was Popular. - Look, they're trying to hit that poor thing. - Watch you don't knock out a fish. Just arc it. I don't know which ball's mine. - I won! I won! - Great! We have a winner. There you go, little girl. See how easy it is, folks. Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish. Where did you get that ring? Did you win it? Vada, we have something to tell you. Harry? Vada, we have some good news. Shelly and I are getting married. My fish! We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer. You'll be okay, little fish. Vada, would you like us to get you another goldfish? No. He's fine. Fish are very resilient animals, you know. Don't worry. I won't get another fish. The bumper car! The bumper car! For just 50 cents, a half dollar, five dimes, ten nickels, we have a ride that's guaranteed to rearrange all of your internal organs. Don't pass me by! That's the bumper car ride! Bumper cars! You can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars. I'd fall asleep at the wheel. - I'll ride on the bumper cars with you. - Great, Vada, come on. Two. I got the blue one! - No. - Yes. I'm going to come get you. Vada, keep your hands on the wheel. Careful, Vada. Careful. Shelly, look out! - Hi, Vada. - Hi, can Thomas J. come out? Sure, come on in. - Hi, Vada. - Hi. Want to ride bikes? Sure. - Did you make your bed? - Yes. - You're sure? - It's made. Come here. You've got a milk mustache. Come on, let's go. - Bye, Mrs. Sennett. - Bye, Ma. Have fun, kids. - I'm running away. - Where you running to? California. Going to Hollywood to live with The Brady Bunch. - I want to live with them, too. - No, you can't. They have enough kids. You'll have to live with The Partridge Family. Really? That's it. - Get up. - I'm tired of running away. Besides, we passed this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere. So, why are you running away? - My dad gave Shelly a ring. - Wow! Was it a decoder ring? You're such a retard. It was an engagement ring. They're getting married? So now you have a mother. I don't like her. I do. She's real funny. He likes her better than me. - I'm hungry. I can't last any longer. - Then go home, baby. I have to, anyway. My mom will be worried. Leave then. Some friend you are. You can come to my house for dinner. No, I'm hiding out. Okay, see you. Are the gentlemen going to stay or not? Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds. The whole Circle fortune goes to you. $20 million. Oh, yes, I heard you all right. Twenty million, that's quite a lot, isn't it? It will do in a pinch. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it. In social studies we learned some people stole the Lindbergh baby right out of his house. I think I'll sleep with my window open tonight. Oh, my God! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - Daddy! - Vada, what's the matter? Where's Daddy? - He just left. What's wrong? - I'm hemorrhaging. What do you mean, you're hemorrhaging? - I don't want or need your help. - Vada, did this happen in the bathroom? - How old are you? - I'm 11 and a half. It's okay. Come on upstairs. We have to have a little talk. My mommy and daddy did that? Actually, a very beautiful thing. And look, there wouldn't have been a Vada. I think it should be outlawed. Believe me, someday you'll feel differently. That's probably Thomas J. I don't want to see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys. Hi, Vada. Can you come out? I don't know. Please. It's real hot. Maybe we can go swimming. No. Get out of here. And don't come back for five to seven days! Gramoo, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Stay here. - Really? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. All right, Ma. Very, very sorry. Now what were you thinking, huh? It's your responsibility to watch her! Do you have any idea how upset those people are in there? Why do you think people want to get married? When you get older, you just have to. I'm going to marry Mr. Bixler. You can't marry a teacher. It's against the law. - It is not. - Yes, it is. 'Cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair. Not true. Have you ever kissed anyone? Like they do on TV? No. Well, maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal. But I don't know how. Here, practice on your arm like this. Like this? Okay, enough practice. Close your eyes. Then I won't be able to see anything. - Just do it. - Okay, okay. Okay, on the count of three. One. Two. Two and a half. Three. Say something. It's too quiet. Just hurry. ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America - ""and to the Republic for which it stands. - ""For which it stands. - ""One nation under God, indivisible. - ""One nation under God, indivisible, - ""with liberty and justice for all."" - ""with liberty and justice for all."" - You better not tell anyone. - You better not either. - Well, let's spit on it. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Okay, see you. Vada? What? Would you think of me? For what? If you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler. I guess. Yes. No. God, no. Get away. Get away! Hi, Vada. Hi. What are you doing? Feeding my fish. - Is that the fish you won at the carnival? - Yes. He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute. Vada, something happened to Thomas J. last night. He stepped on a beehive. I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung? Maybe I should go over and yell at him. No, sweetheart. You can't. Why not? He was allergic to bees. He's okay, isn't he? There were just too many of them. Dr. Welty! Dr. Welty! Vada, what's wrong, sweetheart? - I can't breathe. I'm suffocating. - Wait, relax now. Let me look. It's okay. Up here, we'll have a look. That's a girl. It hurts. It hurts so bad. - Make it stop. - What hurts, Vada? The bee stings! I can't breathe. Vada? I'm leaving some food for you by the door in case you get hungry. - Hi. - Hi. Is Vada home? Yes, she is, but she's very upset so she's not seeing anyone. I'm Judy. I go to school with her. I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J. Well, maybe she'll feel better in a couple days. Will you tell her I came by? - Sure. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Reverend Moss. The Sennett's want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly. Vada? I see you took your tray in. Maybe you should come down for the funeral. Sometimes it helps. Vada? She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something, Harry. The funeral's starting. Open your eyes. She's 11 years old. Her only friend in the world is dead. I know that, but what do you want from me? Stop hiding, Harry. You run, Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people didn't exactly thrill me. But when I saw a family lived here, I thought, ""If I'm living without a family, ""at least I can work with one. ""And maybe once in a while be invited in for supper."" Yeah. And when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive. I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death, Harry. Don't ignore the living. Especially your daughter. Excuse me, Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin. Thank you, Arthur. We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He was born May 7, 1961 in Madison, Pennsylvania. He is survived by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett, his grandparents, William and Gloria Sennett, and Gerald and Marjorie Finn, and many relatives, friends and schoolmates. The interment will follow at Madison Memorial Park. The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed to the cemetery. No words I could say would begin to express the loss and grief we feel. One word that keeps ringing in my ear is ""why?"" Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? Well, I can't give you an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen Thomas J. for some very special reason. We must find solace in knowing that Thomas J. is in God's care. In that place, there is no sorrow or suffering. The lion lies with the lamb. The day is not divided. I'd like to read a passage from the Bible. This is Matthew 19:13. ""At one point, children were brought to him ""that he might lay his hands on them and pray. ""The disciples began to chastise them. ""But Jesus said, 'Let the children come to me. ""'Do not hinder them. ""'The kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ' ""And he laid his hands on their heads ""before he left that place."" Let us pray in silence. You want to go tree-climbing, Thomas J? His face hurts. And where is his glasses? He can't see without his glasses. Put his glasses on. Put on his glasses. He was going to be an acrobat. - He's gone, sweetheart. He's gone. - Get away from me! Vada, wait! Vada! Vada! Vada, I was just on my way to your house. Are you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J. Okay, we don't have to talk about him. Vada, Vada, we don't have to talk about him. It's okay. We won't talk about him. Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel. Come here, sit down. Sit down over here. Mr. Bixler... I love you. Vada... I love you like my dad loves Shelly. I want to live here. I think your dad would miss you. No, he wouldn't. I can't go home. Jake, I'll be ready in a second. I can't seem to find my other earring. Suzanne, this is Vada. Vada, hi. I'm really sorry. - Could you just give us a minute? - Yeah. Who's that? That's Suzanne. She and I are going to be married this fall. No. I was going to bring her to class next week. I want her to hear your poem. Vada. Please, honey. I cared for him, too. Vada, please. Get away from me. Vada! Vada, sweetheart, don't... Why do you think people want to get married? When you get older, you just have to. Who's that with your dad? That's my mother. I'm going to be an acrobat when I grow up. Vada? Would you think of me? If you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler. Now we're blood brothers for life. Shelly, I'm sorry, but we haven't found her yet. It's dark. She can't be alone in the dark. - We'll keep looking. - We've been looking since this morning. - Her teacher called and he said... - I know, I know. You told us. Vada? Are you okay? Oh, God. I should have told Thomas J. that he was my best friend. I'm sure he knew. Shelly. I stole some money from your cookie jar to pay for the writing class. - It's okay, sweetheart. - I'll pay you back. Besides, I don't think I'll ever go to class again. I'll tell you what. You dedicate your first book to me. I'll forget the whole thing. - I will. I promise. - Okay. Get into bed. - Good night. - Good night. She's here. Did I kill my mother? What? The bees killed Thomas J. and I killed my mother. No, no. Now, sweetie, that wasn't your fault. Things like that aren't anybody's fault. It just happened. I found this. I forgot about that picture. - Where did you find it? - In the garage. That little Chevy was your mother's favorite car. What was my mama like? She was pretty. And kind. And she had your eyes. Boy, did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her. Really? You know what your mother did when she found out she was going to have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she would have a little girl. Do you miss her? Yes. I did, very much, for a long time. And even now I get a little sad when I think about a pretty flower or a beautiful sunset that your mother would have liked. I think every time I see or climb a tree I'll think of Thomas J. That's good. Memories are good, sweetheart. Vada, I'm... I'm sorry. I was trying to keep it from you. I just couldn't. You're a good girl. I want you to be happy. Don't be an old grump like me. See you in the morning. Daddy? It's not so bad to be like you. Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing? Some days I think I'll be okay. Others... Well, I have to force myself even to get out of bed. I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's just away at summer camp. How's Vada? She's doing much better. She's just inside. Vada! - Mrs. Sennett. - Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see you. Thomas J. had this on him. I thought you might like to have it. You were such a good friend to him. I hope you'll still come by and visit me. I will. I promise. Mrs. Sennett, Thomas J. will be all right. My mother will take care of him. Thank you, Vada. ""Encased in talent, like a uniform ""The rank of every poet is well known ""They can amaze us like a thunderstorm ""Or die so young ""Or live for years alone."" My advice to you on our last class, be a thunderstorm. What exactly do you mean by that? I mean, be dangerous, and unpredictable, and make a lot of noise. Vada. Hey! We missed you, man. Give me a hug. I was hoping you'd stop by today. Can't stay. I just came to read my poem. We'd love to hear it. ""Weeping willow with your tears running down ""Why do you always weep and frown? ""Is it because he left you one day? ""Is it because he could not stay? ""On your branches he would swing ""Do you long for the happiness that day would bring? ""He found shelter in your shade ""We thought his laughter would never fade ""Weeping willow, stop your tears ""For there is something to calm your fears ""You think death has ripped you forever apart ""But I know he'll always be in your heart."" - Hi, Judy. - Vada. Things are a little better these days. I finally swallowed that chicken bone. Judy and I are going to be in the same homeroom, and the Republican Party just renominated Mr. Nixon.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/My_Girl-102492
Sugar Hill (1974) - full transcript,"After mobsters kill her boyfriend, Sugar Hill makes a deal with Baron Samedi through a voodoo priestess. Trading her soul, she commands a zombie army to exact revenge on those who thought they escaped justice.","Diana. Thank you. You make good drinks. -Did you like the show, Sugar? Dynamite. Dynamite. That's what people say about you. They could be right. Apparently, I'm handling it well. Perfect. - Just perfect. I love you, Sugar. I love you too, Langston. Hey, Langston, my man. I'm not your guy. I'll tell you one last time. You don't tell me shit. - Isn't he a tough nigga? He sure is. He must have forgotten who we are. Well, no, he's just messing with us. Right, Langston? Step closer and find out. Enough with the bullshit. - You stop. Mr. Morgan just wants to give you a fair price for your club. Straightforward. What the hell does Mr. Morgan know about what's fair or not? He can take his offer and shove it up his ass. Your final word? Final. You got a nice broad there, Langston. Lot of class for a zipper guy like you. Fabulous, I'm throwing you out. Now. Well, yes, brother. That's right. We didn't come to swindle you. We're just businessmen. Business works, or it doesn't. They're playing a game with you, honey. I'm not worried, Sugar. Neither should you. I'll get rid of that scum in no time. I don't want anything to happen to my husband. It won't. Nothing like that, Sugar. I gotta get to that meeting. Enjoy your drink. What do you want to do with him? He's just trash. Leave him be. What did they do to you? Please don't leave me alone, Langston. The guy was tough, but he had to go down. You made sure he never got up again. Like I said, gentlemen, if you want to destroy a man, you have to do it once and for all. Put him under. Nothing more now than a piece of cold, black meat. This is our way of working from now on. If Morgan wants something, Morgan takes it. No fuss, simple, direct, to the point. No frizzy heads getting in our way. The guy had no manners. - He doesn't need them anymore. The question is, how do you go about buying the club from a dead man? Celeste, honey, it's been a long day. I'll figure it out in the morning, okay? Come on, Fabulous, you can do better than that. I'll get you an honest your living. Diana? Valentine. It's been a while. You look good. Do I? I'm sorry about the circumstances. It's strange. After we broke up, it bothered me for a long time that you were with Langston. Yeah,but you turned out all right. Anyway, I never thought I'd be questioning you about his death. Murder. I met him here. He stepped up to me and asked my name. Diana Hill, I said. He said, from now on your name is Sugar. Sugar Hill. Because you look so sweet like sugar tastes. Are you handling the case? Do they ever turn for it? Men like that. They'll pay. Many times. You know, if I knew who they were, I'd arrange it so that I could watch them die one by one. Slowly. Mama? Mama Maitresse? Are you here, Mama? Please answer, Mama. Mama Maitresse? - Are you here? Mama. Why have you come back in here? You have come to see Mama Maitresse? - Why? I need your help. I can feel your troubles, it surrounds you. I was in love, Mama. But then they killed the man I was going to marry. They beat him to death. I want them dead! I can feel both your anger and your pain. And I sympathize with you. But what can I do? I know what you can do. The powers you posses! A long time ago, no more! I am old and weak and want only to be left alone. I've come to you because I know you can help me! I am tired, very tired. It takes great effort, I don't know. Please, Mama! I beg you. Child, you have always been a disbeliever. Why do you now believe? Because I want revenge! Please, Mama Maitresse. How strong is your hate? As strong as my love was, my hate is stronger. The risk is great. I am ready. Good. Into the flame, I will call on the most powerful of my voodoo gods. Where does the sun rise? In the east, Mama. Where does the sun set? In Guinea, Mama. Where does the power come from? The living among the dead, Mama. Who can use the power? The dead among the living. Kneel down. Baron Samedi. Baron Samedi. Keeper of the dead. King of the graveyards. Hear our cry. Show your presence. Appear at our call. He is a greedy God. Do you have any money? No, nothing. Nothing, what? Baron Samedi, a gift for you. Try again, Mama. - Your ring, give me your ring. Another gift, Baron Samedi. Who woke Baron Samedi from his sleep? Baron Samedi. It's you, Mama Maitresse. We have come to ask for your help, Baron. - Help? I wish to possess the power to destroy my enemies. Woman, who are you? I am Baron Samedi, this is my territory. My kingdom of the dead. She means no disrespect, sir. Her name is Diana. What will this Diana give to Baron Samedi for the power she seeks? Who are they? - They are the brides of Baron Samedi. He is a great lover. -What will you give me? My soul. - Your soul? What is this talk of souls, woman? I'm not interested in souls. You don't fear me? No. Then tell me, why do you want my powers? I want men to be punished. -Punished? Dead. And I mean more than one man. Can you help me? I have an army of the undead waiting for your orders. Rise again. Listen, all of you who are sworn to obey the will of Baron Samedi. Slave and master. Master and slave. Wake up. I grant you your revenge. But evil is all they know and desire. All right, I need ten men. For a container on a cargo ship. I have the job. You don't have a nut unless you dock. I got a banana boat coming in from Costa Rica. What do you think, guys? As many bananas as you can carry. And you're getting paid. We don't like to pay to work. Okay, no dough, no work. Next. We don't buy jobs. -What did you say? You buy your job, slave boy. Or you starve, understand? You got that? You have more sense than I suspected. All right, that's it. Who's there? I said, who is it? Hey, white girl! You and your scum killed my husband. You know, you actually have the best ass in the neighborhood. I'd hate to see it get cold for slander. I'm not accusing you, handsome. I'm pronouncing your sentence. I'm not getting to you, am I? And the verdict is: Death. Bullshit. Please don't kill me. I didn't mean to. He made me do it. I didn't mean to. No, please. That'll do. I thought I saw everything. - Let it develop immediately. I came as soon as I could. Is it Tank Watson? We think so. You think so? We got something, Captain. Come on. Well, what are you waiting for? How can you eat after what happened to Tank? The boys are pretty shaken up. He got cut up. Tell me about it later, I said, later. Get out there and find out who's behind this. Now, you oaf. All right, all right. Don't get excited, it's not good for you. You know that the slightest tension will upset your stomach. Celeste, sometimes you almost convince me that I am that I'm justifiably nice to you. How you treat me, is fine with me. This will already relieve some of the tension. The rest will follow later. People refuse to leave me alone. A stoner hippie kills Tank and the rest of them start... acting like women. So no traces on this? - Just an old slave cuff. Kids find these from time to time in the swamps. Nothing special. - Damn it. This was near the murdered man. This is what I want you to see. What am I supposed to see? - It came out of Tank's neck. So? - It's a fungus. What kind of mold? - Not the kind you find on cheese. Okay, where do you find this one? No idea. But the one that Tank grabbed had dead skin on his fingers. You're nuts. Dead skin and mold? Lieutenant, I'm not talking about dead skin cells being replaced, that would be normal. We're talking about the nerve endings, pigment cells, epidermis, all dead. You mean the cells are not living tissue. Then the killer wouldn't be a living human being. That a dead tank killed Watson. Your words, not mine. Here she comes, boss. Glad you could make it. I was afraid you had other commitments. I did, but they can wait. Good, very good. Have a seat, Miss Hill. Would you like some food? I have the best chef in town. No, nothing for me. But go ahead. I've finished eating. A cup of coffee perhaps? Pour Miss Hill a cup of coffee. I'm not a waitress. I said, pour coffee. I'm really fine. Thank you anyway. Terrible thing happened to Langston. You know, I considered him a friend. We were going to be business partners. I negotiated his club, Haďti. He left me the club. Imagine, a fast guy like Langston leaving that club to you. to leave you that club. - Why is that surprising? A lady like you wouldn't want to run a place like that. I don't know. It's a success. It won't be hard to manage the club. Forgive me, but you're being a little naive. Naive? How so? If you understood the business world, you'd know of countless examples of how how successful businesses suddenly fail. What are you getting at? That you'd better sell the club to someone who understands who knows about nightclubs. Honestly, Mr. Morgan, I wasn't thinking about it. It's just Morgan. For my friends. We're going to be friends, right? And as a friend, I advise you to sell. I'm not entirely convinced. I'm still pretty upset about it, Of course, I understand that. Those things take time. Of course. Yes. Poor Langston. Of course, I always fulfill my obligations, both to the living and the dead. So do I. So will you think about what I said? I certainly will, Morgan. It was a pleasure, Miss Hill. My friends call me Sugar. Nice. Nice. A feisty lady. You didn't even introduce me to that nigger. What do you think I am? A piece of furniture? Celeste, everybody knows what you are. I'll give Langston credit, he had a taste for class. Class? That's not class, that's a gimmick. Whatever it is, you could use some. Are you waiting for Morgan? - Yes. He's not coming. - Says you. Sweetheart.., be smart and just get out of here. Celeste, you'd do well to show some manners. Even if you don't have any. Out you go. Get out. Funny. You must be forgetting that this is my club. It's you who knows where the door is. Don't you dare get cocky with me. Haughty? About you? Baby, talking to you is already derogatory. You nigger. With my compliments. You black whore, you'll pay for this. You'll pay dearly for this. Listen, you got one day to come up with the dough. Or the whole lot and your skin are mine. Understand? Yes? Yeah? Good. We don't want to make Mr. Morgan sadly angry, do we? Sir? - Mr. O'Brien? Are you talking to me, slave boy? Mr. Morgan says he wants to talk to you now. What? He told me. And old Sam, he doesn't contradict Mr. Morgan. No, he's not. He's a mean man. He told me so, All right, all right. Come on, let's go. Here we are. Where's Morgan? - I brought you to him. Who's with him? - Big shots from out of state. This way, sir. They're over there, sir. What's that over there? Hello, handsome, do you remember me? Odd O'Brien. No. - I want to show you something. Wait till I get out of here. - Look. You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? Like with Tank, you mean? Was that you? I don't think so. Then we'll have to convert you. You had your fun, message understood. You're not planning on doing anything other than that, are you? Of course not. I gave you my word. I promised. Poor little pigs. Did you know they didn't get any garbage for almost a week? They're awfully hungry, I'll tell you that much. Then feed them. - That's my point. My God, no. Hopefully they like good white meat. That's all, ladies. I'll call if I want to see you tomorrow. Well, there. - Hello. One thing hasn't changed. You work as hard as ever. You were gone a long time, Valentine. If I remember correctly it had more to do with you than me. What brings you here today? Work. - It used to be fun. Yes, in the past. It would be nice if it could be done again in present time. Things change with time. Sometimes back to their old self. You probably heard about the murders. - What murders? Two of Morgan's are male. I don't have to mourn that, do I? I didn't know them but knew what they were. Scum. I get the impression that their deaths were some kind of punishment. What's that supposed to mean? Honey, I'm a cop. They sometimes get suspicions that seem far-fetched. But those suspicions are sometimes better than any evidence. I'm not accusing you of acting on your suspicions, Valentine. I'm just saying that you're wrong this time. Maybe you really don't know anything about the murders. Just for old times' sake, be careful. Morgan is not to be trifled with. I'm smart enough to know that. I know exactly how smart you are, Sugar. You're capable of doing anything you set your mind to. Valentine, do I really look like a psycho killer? That's not a fair question. - Why? Honey, in my eyes you're always beautiful. I intend to keep in touch. - Do that. Lieutenant. Hello, my dear fellow. Looking for me? You better believe it. Why? Georgie. You're a big guy. Can't you figure that out? You chicks just can't get enough of the good stuff, can you? White is white. I thought you were into me. That time at Morgan's I saw the way you looked at me. My car is waiting outside. Or would you rather stay here, and have a little talk? Come in, Georgie. Fancy it. - Do you like it? What's that? - For the cover of a magazine. Looking for anything in particular? There's something wrong with this place. The candles, the dolls, that. I don't like the whole thing. Nothing about it. You and I are going to have a talk. - Talk, what do you mean, talk? Why did you bring me here? You've got three seconds to tell me what's going on here and who you work for. - You sure you want to know? Who? - Him. What's that for? When the doll's in flames, you take the knife and you use it. On yourself. That's madness. Or justice. My kind of justice, Georgie. I won't do it. - Yes, you will. No, I won't do it. I can't. No. I won't do it. I refuse. Don't do it. You will die by your own hand. Very relaxed. There's nothing you can do. I have the power to kill you. Use the knife, Georgie. Choose it. Who is it? - Nobody. But someone brought you something. What the hell is this? No idea. Get the phone. Fabulous is gonna be here any minute. Doctor Parkhurst. Rudolph Valentine, how nice to see you again. Come on in. We only see each other when I can use some help. Please have a seat. - Thank you. Not that voodoo stuff again? No talismans and stuff? No. I closed that department a few years ago. Homicide now. - Good for you. Interesting. A cup of tea? No, thanks. Doctor Parkhurst, I sought you out because you were the only one who would believe me. That's a strange statement. There were three murders recently. I can't go to my superiors with this. They laugh at me out loud. I don't understand. A slave cuff. Where did you find it? It's possible evidence. Late 40s. Maybe early 50s. Slaves were brought here from Guinea. Many didn't survive the trip because of the diseases on board. They lay outside the city in swamps in soggy graveyards. Most with their shackles still on. In fact, this could be a powerful youjou. Joujou? A voodoo toy. I suspect the three murders involve voodoo. The buoy was found near the crime scene. And there's still tangible evidence. Dead skin. The way the murders were committed. Almost ritualistic. The best library on the subject is in this room. And I like to shed light on things. One aspect in particular? Yes, the secrets. The curses, the rituals of voodoo. When can we get started? - We? I'm not stepping up to my boss without something to back up my story. All the records are in there. What does that mean, nothing? Boss, I looked everywhere possible. Nobody's talking about these murders. Especially not to me. Anything that has to do with you seems to be bewitched. Someone's cooking something up and I want to know who. You go out there and put pressure on anyone who knows me. Every errand boy, client and snitch. Let 'em know I want the sheet of whoever's hunting me. Scare them good and get this over with. Easy, honey. Relax. - Did I ask you? Come on, let me help you. How the hell would you be of use? You know what? Forget it. Can't you see I'm trying to help you? I see nothing but emptiness when I look at you. What's that supposed to mean? Get out of my sight. Hey, preacher. I want to talk to you, man. I said let's talk. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Nothing happens without you knowing about it. Who approached Tank? And O'Brien? And George? Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew. Don't fuck with me, nigger. Who did? If you don't know, ask around. Maybe this will jog your memory. Buddy.., if you want to keep your head in one piece, you didn't see a thing. Yeah, I didn't see anything. But I definitely didn't see anything. Maybe a drink on the house. My special cocktail. A drink I'm famous for. The zombie. Soak it in, Sambu. You. - Yes, King. Me. Help me. Help you? I'll help you, honey. Like Tank and the rest helped Langston. I wasn't there. I didn't do anything. You'll get your punishment for all the times you didn't get caught. Tough break. Help me. Keep talking Please. Baron. A moment more and Morgan will realize that he is the only one left. That he is completely alone. He will wish that his own death was so merciful. Preacher. Man, you gotta talk to me. - Yeah, talk, yeah. Would you remember them if you saw them again? I don't ever want to see anything like that again. Never, ever. Relax. I've never seen anything like this. Not like this. Never. Picture it again. Can you recognize them? They were like corpses. If I encounter them again, I hope they don't recognize me. Like corpses? Yes, like corpses. You can have these. The pressure is terrible. That voodoo's fascinating. It swallows you up. I've been studying it all my life and I'm afraid it's only now that I'm beginning to understand what it means. Are there any voodoo priests here? - Yes, there are. It's not something the people talk about. There was a voodoo queen for many years. She held a lot of power. It was rumored that she could bring the dead back to life. How long has she been dead? - Dead? Mama Maitresse is not dead. Where can I find her? I have no idea. We always met at a fork in the road. Where the Way of the Cross ends by the railroad tracks. That's close to Frenchmen's corner. - Yeah, right. Why? Valentine at Hill's house. How's it going? I'm surprised I found you here. I get away when I can. - Totally agree. The city can be crowded at times. It's calm and peaceful here. Strange that we never spent much time here. We'll have to make up for that. I've been hitting the books. You never told me that your childhood home has such an interesting history. Interesting? - Voodoo, to be exact. Every old house in this area has a history. Yeah, but no resident priestess. What do you mean? Is it possible to speak Mama Maitress? Why on earth would you do that? - It's just a hunch. Maybe she can help me. There's something odd about all these murders. Every single one has something to do with voodoo rituals. You do grasp at straws. Good evening, Miss Hill. Lieutenant, this is, Old Sam, sir. I've been the handyman here since time immemorial. The Lieutenant is fascinated by voodoo and wants to speak to Mama Maitresse. Voodoo, sir? Come on, let's go find her. - Best let Old Sam lead the way. The swamp is crawling with vermin. Snakes and such creatures. After you, Sam. Did you know that victims are buried here from the slave trade? Yeah, every kid who goes to school here knows that. This man is not a believer. You shouldn't go after her. One thing Old Sam knows, is that you only see Mama when she wants to see you. Yes, but, It's better to wait. When the time is right and it must be, she will meet you. She's still in good shape for a 100-year-old. Don't be bothered, she's an old, grouchy woman. Diana, do you believe in the undead? - What? The undead. - Zombies. Valentine, you're nuts. I'll let you in on a secret. I do believe in them. Everyone has the right to believe in whatever they want. I have to go. I'll call you tonight. Karl, could you point the reflector more to the left? Sugar? I'd like to talk to you. Yes, of course. Girls, take a break. The documents have been prepared for the sale of the club. Good, the sooner these worries go away, the better I'll feel. Do you have the papers with you? - Fabulous. Thank you. Morgan, I know the value of the club. This is theft. Theft? I don't like games. Do you? I was never very good at them, so obviously I'm not. Unless I have the advantage and know that I will win. Are you saying I'll lose if I don't give you your way? It's for your own good. Sign those papers and your worries are over. In the blink of an eye. You have as much money as you want and all the time to enjoy it. How about a little extra for my cooperation? Something the taxes never find out. You won't miss it, Morgan. How much? 10,000 sounds good to me. 5,000 sounds better to me, but I want to start our relationship off positively, so, 10,000 is a deal. You're so nice and accommodating. I should have asked for more. You're too smart a girl to take things too far. That's what I like about you. That and more. I must get on with my work. - Of course. Go ahead. I don't want to disturb an honest, hardworking girl. You don't see many of those. You bring this money to her tonight. Why are you giving her extra money? - Why don't you shut up? Did you hear anything? Idiotic rumors mostly. - Like what? Claims of voodoo murders. Talk that I'd also spread to cover my tracks. Someone wants to take over my territory. Someone from out of state. A local thug we would have found long ago. Shall I travel north? Do some research? I want you to stay close to me exclusively. Like a second skin, understand? Very well. Sugar? Damn it! Damn it! Get off me. My God, get off! Sugar? - Who's there? Now, Mr. Baker, you remember Langston? I got the money with me. You're gonna die soon,Baker. No, the money. - The money, here. Money buys everything, doesn't it? I want to introduce you to Baron Samedi. And what he'll do to you, Mr. Baker, will cost you one penny. It's free and clear. What do you want? What's that for? You don't die without some company, Baker. Money, the answer to everything. Take it with you. Wonder what you'll buy where you'll go. I waited all night. Your guy didn't show. 10,000 dollars. I'll find the bastard and when I do, bring me Baker or the money. Hurry up. All right. You got it. I assure you, it'll be fine. Are you trying to trick me? How do I know you're not trying to trick me? After all, you were Langston's girl. You have no reason to, how can I put it? to like me. I can think of 10,000 reasons to like you. Just trust me. You won't regret it. I wish. I put myself first to trust no one. But I can be convinced sometimes to make an exception. Let's go. Just convince me, okay? Trust me. If I find out you're cheating on me you'll die with remorse on your lips. Get the hell out of here. I think it's a lot of money to play a prank on a friend. Excuse me. Good day. L'amour's massage. L'amour herself. Yes. - Six o'clock tonight. Thank you for calling. I doubt if I should. Hundred dollars. 120 dollars? - I'm convinced. Are you sure he'll come? He hasn't missed a single Thursday in six months. Good. What can I do for you tonight, pal? Where's Opal? - She has Spanish flu. She asked to take care of you. By you? Her pretty, sensual friend is coming to see you tonight. But since Opal's sick, you won't regret it. Hello. Like what you see? You must be the one, big guy. I'm tense, my back is stiff. Better work on that. Great. Do it rough. -How come you're so tense, honey? I don't want to talk about it. I'm getting an idea. I'm sure you do. It's quiet tonight. Would you like some exotic dolls to massage you? You know, like in the movies. I'll even get you a discount, baby. I'm all yours. All right, then. Stay right there. I'll be back soon. What's taking you so long? I get lonely fast. What are you scratching me with? Your hands are cold. I don't like this. Treat me gently. Enough! Enough! I know it sounds crazy. But I immersed myself in that voodoo. I told you to let it go. Your imagination is guiding your actions. It's a gang war. We're just missing the other gang. Captain, that seems like the most logical explanation. But we checked with all our contacts. And I'm sure Morgan did the same. We're both at a loss. Are you seriously suggesting that someone is using voodoo to kill Morgan's men? Possibly. Maybe not. Check it out. Inconspicuous. If this gets out, they'll lock us both up. Do you like that policeman? - I like him, yeah. Does it bother you? - Me, Sugar? Nothing bothers me. He's on your trail. What are you going to do about it? That's why we're here. Stop him. But don't kill him. Killing him is easier. Do as I ask. - It's already done. Valentine, are you dressed? What happened? - I fell down the stairs. I don't understand. And neither do the doctors. I know my leg is broken, but I feel no pain. That's bizarre. Valentine, you were working too hard. Rest. I'm sure you'll be quickly discharged from here. How sure? - Just you wait. I can't stay. I have an appointment. I'll see you later. Diana. I see what's going on here. I don't know how big your share is in all this, but if I find out, I won't know what you're talking about. See you soon. Hey, there. What do you want? He's not here. I'm telling you he's not here. - Who is? Yes? I decided not to sell the club after all. - Yes. You're hanging. My decision. Don't move. I'm coming to your studio. I'm not there. - Where are you? My old place on Hill Road. - I'll find it. Save your breath. I played your game long enough. Morgan... Go to Hell. I'll take care of that bitch once and for all. Sugar! Come on! What's up? You fooled around? - I ain't going in there. Sugar? Sugar? Where you at, bitch? Morgan! Whore, I'll blow your heart out. What the hell are you? What do you want from me? I swore to get you. For Langston. Good evening, Mr. Morgan. Unfortunately, our first meeting is also our last. You're on your own now, Morgan. Show us what a great guy you are. All the others are dead. Only you remain. Help me! Help me! Help me! For God's sake, help me! Somebody help me! Celeste! Well, woman, you killed them all. Nice and proper. One remains. What are your plans for her? I was thinking Yes, the price I asked for our arrangement. As cheap as that? I prefer you, of course, but she'll do for now. Goodbye, Sugar Hill. A gift for you. Baron. Will you join me? It's over, Mama. You can rest now. Vertaling door Gutte.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Sugar_Hill-72225
One Day in September (1999) - full transcript,The Palestinian terrorist group Black September holds Israeli athletes hostage at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich.,"A morning like any other in Munich... a city where tradition and modernity exist happily side by side. This summer our beautiful city plays host... to the 20th Olympic Games. There, in the center of the future Olympic site, is the Olympic tower. Next to it, the Olympic arena. For many visitors, Munich is a kind of German paradise. We're sure that you'll agree. Well, nobody could foresee what later on happened. From the wires of the APand UPI. Good afternoon. This is Paul Mandel reporting. Another deadline has come and gone- They had their hands tied in front of them, their hands were tied like that. Quite a frightening experience. It wasn't anyJames Bond,; it was the real thing. - I just want to know what happened. - The Games must go on. The deadline appears, to us, to be less than one minute away. - Unbelievable. - Spitz is a Jew, and it was feared... an attempt might be made to seize him. Behind them was an Arab guerilla with some kind of weapon in his hand. All seems to be- It was only a year and three months that I was married to Andre Spitzer... but it made such an enormous impression on me... sometimes it looks like a lifetime. I went fencing, and he happened to be my fencing master. I didn't know he was from Israel at all. He spoke Dutch, but with a slight accent... so I thought he maybe is from Eastern Europe or something. Ankie Spitzer He had something about him which really appealed to me. He was very much at peace with himself... and also with the people around him. It was very attractive to me because... I was not so at peace with everyone and everybody... and certainly not with myself. Being the person that he was, it was hard not to fall in love with him. I am a member of a Palestinian family... which fled our village in Galilee from Zionist gangs in 1948. As refugees, my family moved from camp to camp... before finally ending up at the Chatila camp in Beirut. When I was growing up, I thought there was no future for us... unless we returned to Palestine. If we didn't return, I would spend my whole life... as a refugee deprived of any kind of human rights. So I joined the liberation movement... and was given a gun and trained to use it. For the first time in my life I felt inspired, I felt truly Palestinian... that I wasn't just a wretched refugee... but a revolutionary fiighting for a cause. I joined the revolution since 1967. - Which revolution? - The Palestinian revolution. It has affected the course of the rest of my life. You have only to look at the way I have to do this interview... so many years later, still in hiding. We lived in the northern border between Lebanon and Israel... and it was way out in nowhere. They decided to have their fencing academy there. He was going from town to town, from village to village... to try to teach the youngsters... through the art of fencing, to have respect for each other... because fencing is an aggressive sport. You have a weapon in your hand. You're going to attack somebody. If you attack him right, then you score a point. But he tried to teach the youngsters... how to channel that aggression... into respect for your opponent. It was very tough living there, but I remember that year we lived there... as the most beautiful and most wonderful year of my life. I did a few tours of duty in training camps in Lebanon... and then the leadership sent us to Libya for special training. The training was hard and advanced. We were there for about one month. It seemed to me we were getting special training. We began to get a feeling that something big was underway. He dreamt always to be once at the Olympics. Years before, before I knew him... he said that he was thinking about to get to the Olympics once... 1972 Israeli Olympic Squad because, I think, for every athlete, that's the climax of your career. For Andre and the rest of the Israeli team... the 1972 Olympics held a particular signifiicance... because they were held in Munich, Germany, the birthplace of Nazism. There was a feeling that this was a huge event for the Israeli team... to be coming and attending... and therefore their presence in the Olympic village... certainly their presence in the opening ceremony... when their team marched under the flag of the Star of David... were very emotional moments. The Germans saw the games as an opportunity to erase... the negative memories many still had of the 1936 Berlin Olympics... which had been misused by the Nazis for propaganda purposes. Twenty-seven years after the end of the war... Munich was the ideal opportunity to show the world... the new democratic face of Germany. The friendliness was in overdrive. It was a massive attempt, and it hit you straightaway... Gerald Seymour ITN News Reporter to appear open and modern and shorn of their past. To help promote this new non-militaristic image of Germany... security was kept deliberately lax. Police were banned from the Olympic sites... and in their place were 2,000 unarmed security officers... clad in specially designed outfiits. Jacov Springer Israeli Weightlifting Coach Jacov Springer Israeli Weightlifting Coach But for some of the Israeli team, it was not so easy to erase the past. My father, he was fiive times in the Olympic Games. Five times is a special thing. He was born in Poland in 1921. His father was from Germany originally... and thought that because he's speaking German, nothing would happen to them. Alex Springer So all the family stayed in Poland during the war... but my father ran to Russia. He didn't want to stay because he was afraid something will happen to them. And all the family... his brothers, sisters and his parents... were killed in Poland. He was the only one who survived. Thirty-six years after the Nazi Olympics... Dachau, the first of the concentration camps, was chosen as the site... for an Olympic memorial service. The Israeli team came to the service... along with competitors from most European countries. Dachau is just six miles from the Munich stadium. I think it was very difficult for him with the memories... of his family and what the Germans did to them. I think he felt this. But maybe it was also for him to- to show something to the Germans... that "" Here I am, coming back to the Olympic Games... and you- you couldn't really destroy me. "" Spitz is still holding them off. He's got a half a meter lead. Down on the near side is- But Spitz is gonna go in. Spitz wins the gold medal! Mark Spitz, USA. And that is the whistle anyway, and the United States... have kept their unbeaten record unless- The referee says there's three more seconds to play. The only way they're going to score is by going for a long shot. And they got it! My goodness, I don't believe it. I do not believe it. The Russians have got the gold. Victory for the USSR for the first time ever. Absolutely fantastic. She loves every moment of it! Myself and two others traveled from Libya to Germany... two days before the operation. We went to a hotel which the leadership had given us the address of. There we met up with the rest of the team- another group of three and two leaders who had been in Munich for some time. The following day my friend and I... went to a couple of volleyball games at the Olympic Park. We still had not been told what the target of our operation was to be. After one of the competitions he said, ""Hey, there is the Lebanese team. I'm going over to say hello to them. "" I, coming from Holland, said, 'Are you out of your mind?"" They are from Lebanon. Israel was in a state of war with Lebanon. He said, 'Ankie, that's exactly what the Olympics are all about. Here I can go to them and talk to them. That's what the Olympics are about. "" So he went over and he asked how were your results... and I'm from Israel, and how did it go? To my big amazement, I saw that the people responded... and they shook hands with him and they talked to him... Ankie Spitzer and they asked him about his results. I'll never forget when he turned around and came back towards me... with this huge smile on his face and said... ""You see? This is what I was dreaming about. "" After ten days, Andre's fencers finished their competitions... and he and Ankie traveled to Holland to spend time with their baby Anouk... whom they had left in the care of Ankie's parents. The next morning at 10:00, he had to take the train to Munich. He woke up a little bit late. We got to the train station, and the train had left. I was desperate because I thought he's going to get in trouble... when he gets back to Munich because they're waiting for him there. He said, ""Well, another day with you. "" I said, "" No, let's try the other train station about 30 miles onwards. "" So we raced to the next station... and in Eindhoven in Holland, that's where he jumped on the train. Without a ticket. The train was already in the station. I still remember me running next to the train... and he left. And that was the last time I saw him. On the night of September 4, as Andre arrived back at the village... the Israeli delegation was enjoying a night out at the theater... watching Fiddler on the Roof. They returned to the village at midnight. The night of the operation... we went to the restaurant in the railway station for dinner. There we met with the chief of the organization... who for the first time told us what the target of our operation was. I felt very proud... that for the first time I was able to confront the Israelis. Our passports and belongings were taken from us... so there wouldn't be any clue as to who we were. Then we all went to the village. As we were climbing over the fence... we ran into a group of American athletes... who were sneaking in after a night out. I remember they were drunk. The funny thing is that we actually helped each other to climb over. I held my hand out... and we lifted one of them into the village. We said thank you and good-bye. With the help of members of the East German team... the terrorist leaders had entered and studied the Olympic village... in the days prior to the attack. Now they headed straight for the Israeli men's quarters. We headed towards the building. Each of us was carrying a sports bag... filled with weapons, hidden under clothes. Each of us was given a specifiic task. My job was to guard the outside of the building while the others went in. The Israelis were in fiive apartments. Apartment one housed the team coaches. The terrorists went there first. As they broke in, wrestling coach Moshe Weinberger attempted to stop them... but he was shot and wounded. The leader went into the first room... but didn't realize there was an Israeli behind him. He was attacked full force and his weapon was taken. Another member of our group panicked and shot the Israeli. The terrorists demanded that Weinberger, already heavily wounded... show them where the rest of the Israelis were. At gunpoint, he led them past apartment two... which housed the fiield athletes... to apartment three, which contained the weight lifters and wrestlers. Weinberger calculated that they might stand some chance... of overpowering the terrorists. I got out of bed and went outside... only to find myself standing in front of a terrorist... wearing a balaclava hood and a yellow sweater. The terrorists were already holding all fiive of Gad Zabari's roommates. Now, weight lifter David Berger, suggests they attack the terrorists... saying, ""We have nothing to lose. "" But a gunman understands and jabs a machine gun into Zabari's waist... ordering him towards the exit and back to apartment number one. And that's how I came to be the first in line. My friends are behind me with their heads bowed. I feel in a bit of a daze when suddenly I see... another terrorist ahead of me, wearing a balaclava hood. Suddenly the reality of what's happening hits me. As I get closer, he orders me in this direction. But as he's giving me the order... I push his Kalashnikov aside and run. He shoots two or three rounds at me. But I don't think about the shots, I just run. I run for about 70 meters... and then jump over the village fence and into the first building I see. As Gad Zabari ran away... the already wounded Moshe Weinberger heroically jumped on the terrorists. He was shot and killed. We had no orders to kill. We were forced to only when things went wrong. I heard some shots, so I walked up to the window... and then I realized Moshe Weinberger... has been thrown out of the door... to the pavement. He was naked, without anything on him. Shmuel Lalkin Head Israeli Team And I saw that he was dead because blood was pooling around him. This was when I thought that we were attacked by somebody. This is ABC. I'm Jim McKay speaking to you live, at this moment... from ABC headquarters, Munich, West Germany. The Olympics of serenity have become the one thing... the Germans didn't want them to be: the Olympics of terror. I had the first telephone call from the head of the team... Dan Shilon Israeli Television this morning at 6:00, and he told me that the Arabs are there... and one of the Israelis was killed. His name is Moshe Weinberger... IsraeliJournalist and I saw his body carried out after one hour into an ambulance. That body was smashed... which means he was killed by a machine gun... not by a regular gun. I was sleeping. My parents came to wake me up, and they said... ""We just heard on the radio that there was an attack... at the Israeli quarters of the Olympic village. They killed one of the Israelis, and they say it was the boxing coach. "" I know there was no boxing coach, so I jumped out of my bed. I thought, if it is not the boxing coach, then what coach is it? Maybe it's Andre. How many Israelis are they holding as hostage in the block? Around 16, 17. Thirteen members of the Israeli team as hostages. There are nine hostages. Nobody could tell me if Andre was a part of this... if he was one of the hostages, if he escaped. Nobody could tell me. When I arrived on the scene, I met a young female police officer... who was talking to a man dressed in a white suit. He was Issa, the terrorists'spokesman. Issa expressed his demands in a staccato manner. He was very cool and very determined... clearly fanatical in his convictions. The terrorists handed a communique to the police. In it they demanded the release of more than 200 revolutionary prisoners... from jails in Israel, Germany and elsewhere. If this was not done by 12:00 noon... the hostages would be executed. And you have until 12:00? They said that at 12:00 they will shoot. I certainly took it seriously because I was standing there on gunpoint... where always two or three machine guns pointed on me... and the leader of the terrorists had a hand grenade in his hands. Walther Tr?ger Mayor of Olympic Village So I had to take it seriously. When he was discussing with me, he always had that hand grenade. Somebody's going inside. The negotiators knew nothing about the terrorists... except what they saw. Three were visible at any one time. Issa, the leader, his face blackened with shoe polish. Tony, second in command, usually at the first floor window wearing a cowboy hat. And another man guarding the balcony door. Issa told the negotiators... that a second Israeli had been shot and killed... while trying to overpower his captors. The terrorist leader refused to identify the dead man... or allow his body to be removed... until all the political prisoners on the communique had been released. My camera crew and I ended up, for all of that long day... looking down into this little walkway... very quiet. Gerald Seymour ITN News Reporter And in a sense, you were looking down into the cockpit of world events. We opened up all the radios and television stations... to get some information. Then at 9:00 in the morning, I found out that Andre is one of the hostages. The men in the room: Josef Romano is 31 years old... The men in the room: Josef Romano is 31 years old... an Israeli weight lifter in the middleweight class... David Berger, 26 years old, in the light heavyweight class... Ziev Friedman, another 26-year-old weight lifter in the bantamweight class. These strong men sitting helpless there at the point of submachine guns. Eliezer Halfin, 24 years old, a freestyle wrestler, is in that room. Mark Slavin is 18 years old, a Greco-Roman wrestler. The others are officials, Joseph Gotfriend,Jacob Springer... Andre Spitzer, Kehat Shorr and Amitzur Shapiro. We have a situation. In Israel, the population awoke to the shocking news. Demand the release of some 200 Arabs now being held in Israel. The Israeli government immediately made it clear... that in line with their policy, no deals would be struck with the terrorists. Golda Meir Prime Minister of Israel 1969-1974 If we should give in, then no Israeli anywhere in the world... can feel that his life is safe. It's blackmail of the worst kind. At this time I was the aide-de-camp of Minister Genscher. And the minister was shocked, of course. General Ulrich K. Wegener He wanted to see the Minister of Interior of Bavaria... because he was responsible. We are a federal state. So they talked to each other and they decided to go to the Olympic village. In terms of the politicians and the VIPs who came... they looked to me as if they held none of the cards... as if they basically did not understand, one, how to respond... and two, the mind-set of the people they were dealing with. The Palestinians that one saw, there was that feeling... that they were in charge and that they were dictating. When it became clear to me that negotiation was fruitless... I said to the leader: ""You know our recent history... what was done to theJews by the Germans. You must understand, this makes the situation here particularly difficult. "" I said ""Why don't you let them go and take me instead?"" But he refused. Acting on behalf of both the Federal and Bavarian governments... I offered the terrorists an unlimited sum of money... in exchange for the hostages. This offer was rejected. They said, ""It is not a question of either money or substitute hostages... but only of the 200 prisoners. "" PeterJennings is inside the village... and is observing this with the naked eye. Jim, I am almost directly... over the Israeli building. It will be a famous number before long. It's building 31. It's on Connollystrasse. It does appear to be confirmed- though anything confirmed today is difficult- that these guerrillas are from one of the very extreme left-wing groups... a group called Black September. Continuous delegations go forward. People here are waiting, but unquestionably... the mood becoming more tense. They had set a deadline of noon... which is just an hour and 15 minutes away... saying that they were going to kill all of their hostages at that time. There were other people involved. A friend of mine was a member of the Arab Council... and he also came to negotiate. My overall impression was that they really believed... in the possibility of their demands being met. In my opinion, from a political point of view, this was 99.9% unlikely. I thought and still think that the Israelis would rather have let... their whole athletic team be killed than let this happen. I tried to explain these things to Issa... but he was very skeptical and dismissive of me. Israel remained adamant that no deal could be struck with the terrorists... but to buy time, the negotiators lied to Issa... saying they were still awaiting a definitive answer from Jerusalem. They begged the terrorist leader to postpone his noon deadline. Issa responded only with a new threat- one Israeli would be shot publicly every hour... that their demands remained unmet. We were, I think, a little bit naive. Also the minister. The German government at this time thought... they could negotiate with terrorists. They were thinking that they could talk to them... and convince them to let the Israelis go. But there was no way. So the time to get close to noon and to think that... ""It's almost noon. Are they going to kill him now?"" It was like dying a little bit. A matter of seconds before the deadly ultimatum was reached... the negotiators persuaded Issa to agree to an extension. The deadline now is 5:00 Munich time, noon in New York. It is now 1:25 here in Munich. It's about three and a half hours to the next deadline. Israeli Olympic Committee in Jerusalem has now named the second dead man... as being Josef Romano, a 31-year-old middleweight weight lifter. I can't believe it for one second that my husband has gone. Yesterday I received a cassette... where he said, "" HappyJewish New Year"" to everyone... his brothers, the children- A lot of people I meet in the street or at work... Schlomit Romano when they hear about me being the daughter... ofJosef Romano from M?nchen... they say, ""Oh,you know, when I was little... I admired your father, and he was like this and that. "" All the time I hear new stories and new things... about my father. That's how I know him. Of course, not enough. Like, I can't imagine his voice. I can't imagine him calling my name. They letJosef Romano die, bleeding to death, lying between all his friends... as a warning if anybody tried to grab a weapon from one of the Palestinians... this would be their lot. Nobody has the right to do that. In a way, I didn't like Issa because of what he was doing... but I could have liked him when I met him elsewhere. He was not violent. I would have even trusted him in his word. Not his compatriots and partners. Walther Tr?ger Mayor of Olympic Village They were like- What do we say in German? Galgenvogel. Gallow birds. But Issa was different from them. We were not only negotiating on how to handle this. We also were- I wouldn't call it philosophical... but we were also going into the grounds of the whole thing. I said, ""Why are you doing it?"" He said, ""We are sorry for you. You made good Olympic Games. But you offered us a showcase... and we have to use this showcase in order to show our possibility... to so many millions or even billions of people in the world... who are watching your Olympic Games. "" Mark Spitz, the American swimming star... who won seven gold medals at this Olympiad... was placed under heavy guard shortly after the drama unfurled. Within hours, Spitz was hustled out of Germany on a plane bound for home. Spitz is a Jew, and it was feared an attempt might be made to seize him. Spontaneous demonstrations condemning the attack sprung up around the world. There was outrage that the Olympic ideal of peace and brotherhood... had been so shamelessly destroyed. But as the day progressed, there was also a growing sense of anger... directed at the International Olympic Committee... for refusing to halt the Games in the light of what had happened. The Olympic Committee at that time was very arrogant. Very arrogant. They felt something terrible happened, but they have nothing to do with it. Willi Daume, head of the Olympic Organizing Committee... has announced that the Olympics will go on. As of this hour, the Olympics, the Games of the 20th Olympiad, will continue. This is a live shot you're looking at right now. And we're moving in now on the windows... behind which, at this moment, eight or nine terrifiied living human beings... are being held prisoner. The demands have been many. There's someone right now. And this has happened time and time and time again. The door opening, the head coming out to see what is going on. Within 200 yards of where that building is, there's a manmade pond. Not a formal swimming pool, but a very lovely pond with a little dock... where the athletes lie out and take sun. That's what they're doing right now, sunning themselves. They're swimming, talking of technique with athletes of other countries. And yet this grim, terrible thing is taking place inside the village. There were people running around the training track. I thought,yeah,you've trained for this for four years... but it seemed wrong. There was something selfish, slightly obscene... about the atmosphere in the rest of the village. I didn't hear much of the negotiations. I spent my time standing guard outside. But after some time I was relieved and I went into the room... where the Israelis were being held. I found one of our guys sitting with the Israelis, his gun by his side. We began to chat with the Israelis... and told each other stories and jokes. But then our leader suddenly came in and ordered us to stop messing about. He didn't want us to talk to them too much... in case they tried to emotionally exploit us... and tried to escape. The Germans decided that the time had come... for them to take the initiative. Food was brought in... not only with the hope that the hostages would be fed... but in such large quantities that no one man could carry it alone. The police hoped more than one guerrilla would come out for the fiive boxes... could be rushed and overpowered. A second hope was the chefs could gain access and count the Arabs inside. There were no chefs. It was the police commissioner... Mr. Schreiber, and myself... with two policemen clad as chefs, as cooks. The idea was not to poison the food. The idea was that someone of us... could enter the room... because at that time nobody knew about the number of the terrorists. The deception had no effect. The negotiators reported to the waiting Israeli ambassador... that their plan had failed. The ambassador repeated again that no deal would be made. The Israeli ambassador was watching, together with me... what was going on, and he was not very happy about this. He got out and asked for a phone... and he called the prime minister in Israel. General Ulrich K. Wegener The Israelis, they wanted to send a team... which was rejected by the German government, of course. The prime minister had a long talk with Chancellor Brandt. And I remember her report saying... that he refused that any Israeli team... will come to Germany to do the action. Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad (Israel Secret Service) 1968-74 And the general feeling was that if the German defense- army, whoever- will take it upon itself... they are capable of doing it well in Germany... and there is no necessity to send an Israeli team. At the time, I was the head of the Mossad. And Moshe Dayan spoke with the prime minister... and they insisted that I should go to be present... to see how the Germans do this operation. Zvi Zamir immediately flew to Munich... arriving early that same evening. Almost 11 hours after the start of the crisis... the Olympic Committee finally bowed to intense international pressure... and suspended the Games. Some competitions are continuing. They will be allowed to finish. But at that time the Games will be suspended. At 10:00 tomorrow morning, in the huge Olympic stadium... there will be a memorial service for the two men dead. The Olympic Games are reduced to utter silence... and one tantalizing head poking out a door. Something has to happen. It was a kind of... Dan Shilon Israeli Television a bizarre, surrealistic situation... in which we journalists surrounded the event... with every possible camera. Endless cameras around the Olympic village. It was a great story to many television stations and media around the world. I mean, the climax of the Olympic Games, such an event. And perhaps even some of the stations... took a very cynical approach to it... saying, ""Wow! What an audience we'll get now. "" On a lovely late summer afternoon, the tense vigil continues. In just a half an hour, the deadline will have expired. He definitely had his hands tied. I saw it. Late in the afternoon, I saw that the window was opened... of the apartment where they were kept hostage... and I saw Andre in front of the window. They asked him, ""Is everybody okay there... and what is the situation with all the other hostages?"" Andre said, ""Everybody is okay except for one. "" When the Germans asked, ""Who is the one and what happened to him?"" I saw that he was not allowed to say that. So he got hit with the butt of the rifle of one of the Palestinians... and pushed away, and they closed the curtains. That was the last time, really, that I saw him. After that, Mr. Genscher said... he wished to have a direct discussion with the Israeli hostages. Then Mr. Schreiber said he wished to accompany him. They said, ""No,you are policemen. You are not allowed to enter. "" I said, 'All right. Then it's me. "" So we went up there... and it was a terrible impression, I must say. One was bound to one chair... and the others were on the two sides tied together. And then the one who was killed... was lying there. The wall was full of blood. I will never be able to forget those faces... full of fear, but also hope. Then we had a discussion... and the discussion was... absolutely covered by the... very depressed mood of the hostages. They wished... to come to a conclusion which might save their lives... but they were not very hopeful in that respect. There's been one report attributed to Wilf Brimsley of the Associated Press... There's been one report attributed to Wilf Brimsley of the Associated Press... who said a police lieutenant told him that at 5:00... about 29 minutes from now, Munich time... a volunteer squad of policemen dressed as athletes... would storm the Israeli Olympic team headquarters... and would come in shooting. These are the volunteer squad of 38 police or West German border guards. Because of very complicated laws... the German army would not be allowed to participate. There you see an athlete holding a canvas bag... in which is obviously a machine gun. The commissioner of the police, Mr. Schreiber... selected some policemen, you know... and asked them... have you ever shot a gun or whatever? That was it. They had no training, nothing. Jim, there are now a great many of those security men... in athletic uniforms... moving off in various directions. I don't want to instigate any false drama here... but it looks, at this point, like the beginnings of some kind of deployment. The plan was for us to climb up on the roof... of the Connollystrasse building... and go down the ventilation shafts. Once in position we were to await the code word 'sunshine'... from the Chief Inspector before attacking. That's how we would free the hostages. Walking cautiously on the roof... hopefully not being heard in the rooms below. You see how close these two men are. Couldn't be 20 feet. You see he comes out and gets down on his hands and knees. That's for him to get a better look up. Outside our studio here and around the Olympic village... a crowd estimated at 75,000 to 80,000 people... has gathered, awaiting the outcome of this. This building now swarming with Germans... trying to rescue the Israelis. The deadline appears, to us, to be less than one minute away. Anything to report at all, Peter? The commando looks very much more nervous than he did a while ago... and he certainly has an apprehensive darting-about look from here... almost as if they do sense that something is very imminent. Once again there is a delegation directly under the building... and the Arab guard, not on the balcony... but in the window slightly down below him, is negotiating with him. Now we've gotten an official time check. It is 5:00. This is the deadline. The storming, if it is going to happen, could happen at any moment. We waited and waited, but the code word ""sunshine""never came... because there was a film crew... on the East German building opposite us... which broadcast live everything that was happening on the roof. Later we discovered that there was a TVin every athlete's room... and the terrorists had been able... to watch us preparing live on screen. Thank God we called it off. It surely would have been a suicide mission if we had attacked. If you had told me then that the Germans did not have available in Munich... Gerald Seymour ITN News Service a trained storm squad, I think I would have disbelieved you... because everybody in 1972 was totally transfixed... by a myth of utter German ruthless efficiency. Fourteen minutes to 6:00, Munich time, in the evening. We were told not to let the situation go on for more than 24 hours... because psychologically that was the most we could take. If the Israeli government still refused to release the prisoners... we had been told to demand an airplane... to take us, with the hostages, to any Arab country we could. At 6:00 p. m., the Palestinians issued a new demand. They wanted a long-distance jet... to fly them and their hostages to an unspecifiied Arab country. But the German government and the organizing committee... decided that we were not allowed at all... to let foreigners bring out guests of our country... who came as guests to the Olympic Games. That led to the final conclusion that we give the impression to the terrorists... that we'll let them fly out... but try everything to then kill them... or bring them into prison... before they could leave the country. Our aim was to drag out the proceedings... to wear down the terrorists... and try to establish the best time for freeing the hostages. That was our objective. The organizers of the Games naturally wanted the Games... to resume as soon as possible. We had to find a resolution one way or another. To move the thing from the Olympic compound... Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad (Israel Secret Service) 1968-74 in order to let the Olympic Games to carry on... this was their main objective. The Israeli team... and its rescue were secondary to that. The staff group decided to bring them... to the public airport of Munich in order to try something. I said, ""Listen, that's crazy. We have another airport... which is not a public airport. "" So I proposed to make Furstenfeldbruck the target. The police plan revolved around a decoy Boeing 727... which was to be left on the runway with its engine idling. On board would be a voluntary squad of policemen... disguised as flight crew. The Palestinians and Israelis would be flown in by helicopter. When Issa and his deputy went to inspect the plane... the fake crew would overcome them. Meanwhile, fiive snipers positioned on the tower and around the airfiield... would open fire on the remaining terrorists... and assault vehicles would rush in to rescue the hostages. There were only fiive snipers because the police still believed... there would be a total of four to fiive terrorists. This is PeterJennings in the Olympic village. The Olympic village is built on various levels... and underneath building 31, and underneath all of the buildings here... there is a network of roads. Those alleyways now have been used to bring in... a fairly massive security force, including armored cars... and just a short while ago, Howard Cosell... noticed that there was considerable activity there. Over the recent 25 to 30 minutes... there was a flurry of activity, cars were speeding off... and we now have a corridor or avenue of departure... available to the Arabs... should a deal have been made and should they be coming out... as now seems likely. So there is a quiet now and an expectancy. I didn't feel fear as such. I felt apprehensive, as any person would. I was afraid of failing. The Palestinians and Israelis were to be flown by helicopter... to Furstenfeldbruck Airport. But how would they get themselves and their hostages... to the helicopters, which were on the edge of the village. They decided to walk via the underground car park. The police saw another ambush opportunity... and placed marksmen here... but Issa insisted on checking the route first. So we walked there with one of... the terrorists behind me with a machine gun in my back... and at that time, some of the gunmen of the German police... were lying in the side streets... and when we approached, they were crawling away. So the terrorists immediately found out that there was danger... and they decided to use a bus and not to walk. The terrorists brought the Israelis down a passage... into an underground car park and to a bus. Robert Thompson, a 24-year-old Canadian water polo player... saw them leave. So then they brought seven of them out... and they put seven of the Israelis on the bus... and then he went back inside, and then they brought out more. During this, there was one fellow standing in front of the bus... with a machine gun, watching all of it. The terrorists had all the guns. What were the Israelis doing? They were tied. They had their hands tied in front of them... and plus their hands were tied like that. Then around the back they had ropes, and they were tied together like that. The first man that got out was the man with the white pith helmet. He got out, went over to the first helicopter... and made a complete check with a flashlight. He checked in and out, both back, front and middle of the helicopter... and when he saw that everything looked like it was all right... he signaled, and four hostages started to march out... with their hands tied in front of them... and behind them was an Arab guerilla... with some kind of weapon in his hand. It was quite a frightening experience. It wasn't anyJames Bond. It was the real thing. It has taken less than fiive minutes to reach the waiting helicopters... but in that fiive minutes a critical piece of information... has suddenly been revealed. There are not four guerillas nor even fiive, as the police believed. There are eight, and there are only fiive police marksmen... waiting at Furstenfeldbruck Airport. We were standing at a window directly above... as our friends were led handcuffed from the bus to the helicopters. The terrorists stood there with rifles. They looked as if they felt like heroes dominating the world. All around, flashbulbs were going off. I felt bitter. It's not a movie. It's our people we're talking about! Two were already murdered, and they were making a show out of it. One of the helicopters now proceeds out over the Olympic site... out over the main stadium where half the lights are on. The second helicopter is now following it... and moving out around this tremendously high... major Olympic tower as they depart... to a destination we, of course, as yet do not know. And we, with the German team... we moved to the third helicopter. The third helicopter now moving right by us... right over the Olympic village... passing now over the main stadium. All the lights on in this Olympic site- an Olympic site which for more than a week now... has been a place of serenity and comradeship- an Olympic village which, in spite of some political crisis, has been happy... and now today has been absolutely shattered... by this tragedy. As we were flying... we began to get the feeling that a trap was waiting for us... so we began to prepare ourselves. In the event of an ambush, we had been told to fight... with all our strength, as though in battle. We were to do everything necessary... to defend ourselves and our operation. The marksmen, who had no radio links... were still only expecting a total of fiive terrorists. Nobody from the village thought to inform them... that there were now known to be eight. We rushed quickly into the main building... we moved to the second floor. It was dark- dark in the place. There were very many people in the corridors and around the building- behind the building. From the window we could watch and see the two helicopters... landing in front of us. Just as the helicopters... bearing the Palestinians and Israelis were landing... the police squad assigned to the decoy plane... fearing that they were under-trained... took a vote to abandon their mission. It was quite simply a suicide mission... and we unanimously voted to abandon it. And this was seconds before- not even minutes- seconds before the helicopters landed. I told the minister, I said, ""I'm sure... this will blow the whole affair. "" The Germans had marksmen on the roof of the control tower... and marksmen at ground level... but they had no communications between each other. They were just briefed to shoot. When the first marksmen opened fire, they would all open fire... but there was no coordination of targets. Some of us got out of the helicopters... but others waited inside it with the hostages, who were now very scared. We told them that it was in everybody's interests for them to remain quiet. Now, the leader of the team, he and another one... went to check the aircraft. The Palestinians were obviously missing... the whole crew, because they came back... and were yelling. They were, of course, excited. As the leader returned from the airplane... the whole area suddenly lit up... and an enormous amount of firing started. So we all opened fire in the direction the shooting was coming from. And a key marksman was moving from one position... to another, blocked by a pillar... Gerald Seymour ITN News Reporter to get into another shooting position when the shooting started... and therefore missed the crucial shot against the Black September commander. Issa managed to get back to the cover of the helicopters unscathed. Sniper Two was more successful, seriously wounding Issa's deputy. Snipers Three and Four opened fire on the six terrorists... guarding the helicopters... but inexplicably managed to kill only one. Sniper Five did not fire a single shot. Because the helicopters had been landed in the wrong place... he found himself in the direct line of fire... of his fellow marksmen on the tower. Like the others, he had not been supplied with a bulletproof vest... or steel helmet and found himself hopelessly exposed. Meanwhile, a policeman standing by a window inside the tower... was killed when a stray bullet struck him in the head. They weren't capable. I can tell you that I doubt whether the snipers... were really snipers according to what I listened to. One was lying on the roof... not far away from us. He wasn't firing with a sniper's rifle. But they didn't see it. They didn't see the targets. Unbelievable. The latest word we get from the airport... is that, quote, ""All hell has broken loose out there""... that there is still shooting going on- but all seems to be confusion. Nothing is nailed down. We have no idea what has happened to the hostages. The leader was now on his feet again and shooting... but his deputy was seriously wounded. I crawled over to him and was hit in the hand. My gun flew from my hand. I tried to grab his gun so I could head for cover... but I just couldn't do it. And I only hope that our people... and the Israelis, that they could get out of the helicopter... but they had tied them together or whatever... and so they couldn't leave the helicopters. The entire area is ringed off by troops- heavily armed troops with dogs, keeping everybody away. We tried to approach, were stopped by one of the guards with a machine gun... and he said, "" Do not come closer. They're heavily armed. You're going to get hurt. "" But it's total confusion out there. Just about everybody and his brother and his sister... got into their cars and they've driven to the area. They've clogged the roads. Police reinforcements had a bad time getting there... because all of these people are curious, flocking to the area... clogging up the roads. Just absolute confusion. Then I decided to try and find the commander of the police... and then we said... Zvi Zamir, Chief of Mossad (Israel Secret Service) 1968-74 ""What else? What are you doing?"" Then he said that he is waiting... for armored cars to arrive... from somewhere near Munich. The police had forgotten to order the armored cars... to come to the airport earlier... and it was only now, 20 minutes after the shooting began... that they radioed to Munich for them to be sent. But because the roads were congested with onlookers... they did not arrive at the scene for another hour... by which time most of the fiighting was over. Still no word... the word we really want, from the hostages. We asked them to let us go on top of the roof... and try to negotiate with the terrorists. They refused at the beginning... but then they said, 'All right, on certain conditions. "" We went up on top of the roof... and we started to speak Arabic to the terrorists. Their reply was clear, very clear. They opened fire on the building. General Ulrich K. Wegener They fired at the tower, and I told the minister he should lie down... and he touched down under the desk of the commander. Very funny, from our view today. One of the surviving terrorists now made a dash for it... heading straight for Sniper Five. As the terrorist ran towards him, Sniper Number Five... fired his only shots of the night... point-blank into the fleeing man's face. Seeing these shots... police reinforcements arriving at the scene... with no knowledge of the precise location of their own snipers... mistakenly identifiied Sniper Five and the helicopter pilot... who had fled for cover beside him as terrorists... and opened fire on them. Both were seriously wounded. At midnight came the official announcement... of the spokesman of the German government... who said all the Israelis are saved... and all the terrorists are dead. Conrad Ahlers German Government Spokesman I'm very glad that, as far as we can see now, this police action was successful. Of course, it's an unfortunate interruption... of the Olympic Games... but, I mean, if all that comes out... as we hope it will come out or has come out... I think it will be forgotten after a few weeks. Ankie Spitzer People all over Holland were calling me- all my friends, my family. A neighbor came to us with this bottle of champagne... Alex Springer and we all... was very glad and happy... and I think that I went to sleep. Then the Israeli ambassador in The Hague, he called me and said... ""Ankie, I just heard the news. Congratulations, and everybody is saved... and everything is okay. "" Originally they said that the hostages were safe. Now that has been changed... and an Olympic spokesman said... ""We are afraid the information given so far is too optimistic. "" That's where we seem to stand. So I called the Olympic village. I called every half-hour, and every time the news got worse and worse... and at 3:00 in the morning I said... ""If you know that something happened, then you tell me now... because I'm not Hercules. I have been waiting from 7:00 in the morning... and now it's 3:00 the next morning. I just want to know what happened to Andre. "" We keep hearing that the indications are not good... thatJohnny Klein may have very bad news. After almost two hours of fiighting... one of the surviving Palestinians threw a hand grenade... into the eastern helicopter. The helicopter was refueled... and within minutes... the helicopter and the area around it... was in fire. Simultaneously, one of his comrades... sprayed a full clip of bullets into the other helicopter. Then there was silence. And I told the minister... ""I think I have to go to look for what the police is doing. "" And then I went to the captain of the police company there... and said, ""Are you going to do something? You have to move your people there. You pull out the hostages or whatever, you know... and do something. "" They didn't do anything. ""I have no orders,"" he said. It was- It was a really tragic story... and so we could only look, you know. And when after- You could hear them yelling, you know. We've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my father used to say... ""Our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. "" Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They have now said that there were 11 hostages. Two were killed in their rooms... yesterday morning. Nine were killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone. That afternoon, the Games continued. The surviving members of the Israeli team... flew home with their dead. The bodies of the fiive dead Palestinians... were handed over to Libya, where they received a hero's funeral. Mohammed Safady, Aged 19 The three surviving terrorists were never to stand trial. Adnan Al Gashey, Aged 27 Jamal Al Gashey, Aged 18 Seven weeks later, a Lufthansa jet... en route from Beirut to Frankfurt was hijacked. The hijackers demanded the release of the three Munich terrorists. Acting with indecent haste and without consulting the Israeli government... the Germans handed over the three prisoners. The circumstances surrounding the hijacking... have long been thought suspicious. Why were only 12 passengers on board such a large plane? Why no women or children? Why such haste in agreeing to the hijackers'demands? For the first time, one of the Palestinians involved... has revealed that the entire affair was a setup... organized by the German government in collusion with the terrorists. The Germans thought that in this way... they would prevent future terror attacks on their country... and dispose the embarrassing evidence of their failure that day in September. I think- I think it's probably true, yes. At this time, the mentality was so, you know. Really. Hans Jochen Vogel Mayor of Munich 1960-1972 On such questions, Willy Brandt, as I remember very well... always made this gesture. I can't say and do more. 29th October 1972 Terrorists arrive in Libya Did you shoot any of the Israeli hostages? It's not important to say if I killed Israeli or not. What do you think you achieved? One would have- We have made our voice heard... by the world- Are those your words? - Of course. - The same thing. They have made their voice heard by the universe or the world... who has not been hearing before. I'm proud of what I did at Munich... because it helped the Palestinian cause enormously. Before Munich the world had no idea about our struggle... but on that day the name of"" Palestine"" was repeated all over the world. It was only a year and three months that I was married to Andre Spitzer. But I remember that year as the most beautiful... and most wonderful year of my life. This is the grave of Amitzur Shapiro. He was the athletics coach. He had four little children, one my age. And here is Kehat Shorr. He was the shooting coach. Eliezer Halfin was a wrestler... and so was Mark Slavin, who I think was only 18 years old. And here's my father's grave. Anouk Spitzer And it says on it his name: Andre Spitzer. It says, ""Son ofTibor, fencing coach... murdered by- killed by murderers... in the Olympic Games in Munich... as a representative of the Israeli sport. "" Then it says his date of birth and the date that he was murdered. And I always bring him sunflowers because that's his favorite flower.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/One_Day_in_September-230591
Beauty and the Beast (1991) - full transcript,A prince cursed to spend his days as a hideous monster sets out to regain his humanity by earning a young woman's love.,"Once upon a time in a faraway land a young prince lived in a shining castle. Although he had everything his heart desired the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind. But then, one winter's night an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within and when he dismissed her again the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late for she had seen that there was no love in his heart and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form the Beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast?

Have you got anything new? Not since yesterday. That's all right. I'll borrow... this one. That one? But you've read it twice. Well, it's my favorite... far-off places daring sword fights magic spells, a prince in disguise. If you like it all that much, it's yours. -But, sir... -I insist. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Look, there she goes That girl is so peculiar I wonder if she's feeling well With a dreamy, far-off look And her nose stuck in a book What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him Till Chapter Three Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Now, it's no wonder that her name means beauty Her looks have got no parallel But behind that fair facade I'm afraid she's rather odd Very different from the rest of us She's nothing like the rest of us Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle Wow, you didn't miss a shot, Gaston. You're the greatest hunter in the whole world. I know. No beast alive stands a chance against you and no girl, for that matter. It's true, Lefou and I've got my sights set on that one. The inventor's daughter? She's the one... the lucky girl I'm going to marry. But, she... The most beautiful girl in town. I know, but... That makes her the best and don't I deserve the best? Well, of course. I mean, you do, but... Right from the moment when I met her, saw her I said, ""She's gorgeous,"" and I fell I said, ""She's gorgeous,"" and I fell Here in town there's only she who is beautiful as me So, I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle Look, there he goes, isn't he dreamy? Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute Be still, my heart, I'm hardly breathing He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute -Bonjour -Pardon -Good day -Mais oui -You call this bacon? -What lovely grapes -Ten yards -Some cheese -'Scuse me -One pound I'll get the knife Please let me through -This bread -Those fish -It's stale -They smell Madame's mistaken There must be more Than this provincial life Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife Look, there she goes A girl who's strange but special A most peculiar mademoiselle It's a pity and a sin She doesn't quite fit in 'Cause she really is a funny girl A beauty but a funny girl She really is a funny girl That Belle... Bonjour, bonjour. Hello, Belle. Bonjour, Gaston. Gaston, may I have my book, please? How can you read this? There's no pictures. Well, some people use their imagination. Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books and paid attention to more important things... like me. The whole town's talking about it. It's not right for a woman to read. Soon she starts getting ideas, and thinking... Gaston, you are positively primeval. Why, thank you, Belle. What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern and take a look at my trophies? Maybe some other time. What's wrong with her? She's crazy. He's gorgeous. Please, Gaston, I can't. I have to get home to help my father. Good-bye. That crazy old loon... he needs all the help he can get. Don't talk about my father that way. Yeah, don't talk about her father that way. My father is not crazy. He's a genius. Ooh! Papa? How on earth did that happen? Doggone it! Are you all right, Papa? I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk. You always say that. I mean it this time. I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work! Yes, you will and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow. Humph! And become a world-famous inventor. You really believe that? I always have. Well, what are we waiting for? I'll have this thing fixed in no time. Hand me that, uh... dog-legged clincher, there. So, did you have a good time in town today? I got a new book. Papa, do you think I'm odd? My daughter? Odd? Where would you get an idea like that? Oh, I don't know. It's just that I'm not sure I fit in here. There's no one I can really talk to. What about that Gaston? He's a handsome fellow. He's handsome, all right, and rude, and conceited, and... Oh, Papa, he's not for me. Well, don't you worry 'cause this invention's going to be the start of a new life for us. I think that's done it. Now, let's give it a try. It works! It does? It does! You did it! You really did it! Hitch up Philippe, girl. I'm off to the fair! Good-bye, Papa. Good luck. Good-bye, Belle, and take care while I'm gone. We should be there by now. We should be there by now. Maybe we've missed the turn. I guess I should have taken... Wait a minute. Let's go this way. Come on, Philippe, it's a shortcut. We'll be there in no time. This can't be right. Where have you taken us, Philippe? We'd better turn around. Whoa... Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe. Oh...! Oh, look out! Whoa! Whoa, boy! Back up, back up, back up! Good boy, good boy. That's it. Back up! Steady, steady. Now, steady. Philippe, no! Philippe. Oh... Help! Is someone there?! Oh! What...? Oh... Hello? Hello? Poor fellow, must have lost his way in the woods. Keep quiet; maybe he'll go away. Is someone there? Not a word, Lumiere; not one word. I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse and I need a place to stay for the night. Oh, Cogs worth, have a heart. Shh! Of course, Monsieur, you are welcome here. Who said that? Over here. Where? Allo. Incredible. Well, now you've done it, Lumiere. Splendid, just peachy. Ah! How is this accomplished? Put me down at once! Stop that! Stop that, I say. Ow! Huh... Close that at once. Do you mind?! l-I beg your pardon. It's, it's just that I've never seen a... Oh, you are soaked to the bone, Monsieur. Come, warm yourself by the fire. Thank you. No, no, no. You know what the master will do if he finds him here. I demand that you stop right there. Oh, no, no! Not the master's chair. I'm not seeing this! I am not seeing this! Well, hello there, boy. What service. All right, this has gone far enough. I'm in charge here. How would you like a nice spot of tea, sir? It'll warm you up in no time. No. No tea. No tea! His mustache tickles, Mama. Oh! Hello. Uh-oh. Oh... Ah... There's a stranger here. Master, allow me to explain. The gentleman was lost in the woods. He was cold and wet... Master, I'd like to take this moment to say I was against this from the start. It was all his fault. I tried to stop them, but would they listen to me? No. Who are you? What are you doing here? l-l-I was lost in the woods, and, and... You're not welcome here! l-l-I'm sorry. What are you staring at?! N-Nothing. So, you've come to stare at the Beast, have you?! Please, I meant no harm! I just needed a place to stay. I'll give you a place to stay. Oh, no...! Please! Oh, no! Oh, boy, Belle's going to get the surprise of her life huh, Gaston? Yep. This is her lucky day. I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding. But first I'd better go in there and propose to the girl. And you, Lefou... now, when Belle and I come out that door... Oh, I know, I know! l-I strike up the band. Not yet! Sorry. Gaston. What a pleasant surprise. Isn't it, though? I'm just full of surprises. You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes. This is the day... Hmm. Yeah. This is the day your dreams come true. This is the day your dreams come true. What do you know about my dreams, Gaston? Plenty. Here, picture this: A rustic hunting lodge my latest kill roasting on the fire and my little wife, massaging my feet while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven. Dogs? No, Belle! Strapping boys, like me. Imagine that. And do you know who that little wife will be? Let me think. You, Belle. Gaston, I'm... I'm... speechless. I really don't know what to say. Say you'll marry me. I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... but... I just don't deserve you. Whoa! So, how'd it go? I'll have Belle for my wife. Make no mistake about that! Touchy. Is he gone? Can you imagine? He asked me to marry him. Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... Madame Gaston Can't you just see it? Madame Gaston His little wife No, sir, not me I guarantee it I want much more than this provincial life I want adventure in the great, wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than they've got planned. Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's...? Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe? What happened? Oh, we have to find him. You have to take me to him. What is this place? Philippe, please! Steady! Steady. Papa. Couldn't keep quiet, could we? Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we? Serve him tea. Sit in the master's chair. Pet the pooch. I was trying to be hospitable. Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Papa? Papa? Are you here? Mama, there's a girl in the castle. Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories. Really, Mama. I saw her. Not another word. But... Into the tub. Woop... Well! I saw a girl in the castle! See? I told you. Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy-eared, slack-jawed... Papa? Did you see that? It's a girl! I know it's a girl. Don't you see? She's the one... the girl we have been waiting for. She has come to break the spell! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Papa? Papa? Hello? Is someone here? Wait! I'm looking for my father. I... That's funny. I'm sure there was someone. I-Is anyone here? Belle? Papa! H-How did you find me? Oh, your hands are like ice. I have to get you out of there. Belle, I want you to leave this place. Who's done this to you? No time to explain. You must go! Now! I won't leave you! What are you doing here? Run, Belle! Who's there? Who are you? The master of this castle. I've come for my father. Please let him out. Can't you see he's sick? Then he shouldn't have trespassed here! But he could die. Please, l-I'll do anything. There's nothing you can do. He's my prisoner. Oh, there must be some way I can... Wait! Take me instead. You?! You would... take his place? Belle, no! You don't know what you're doing! If I did, would you let him go? Yes. But you must promise to stay here forever. Come into the light. No, Belle! I won't let you do this! You have my word. Done! No, Belle, listen to me. I'm old. I've lived my life. Wait. Belle! Wait! No, please spare my daughter. Please! She's no longer your concern. Take him to the village. Let me out! Please let me out! Let me out! Please! Oh, please! Master? What? Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room. Then again, maybe not. You didn't even let me say good-bye. I'll never see him again. I didn't get to say good-bye. I'll show you to your room. My room? But I thought... You want to stay in the tower? No. Then follow me. Say something to her. Huh? Oh. l, uh, hope you like it here. The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing. What's in the west...? It's forbidden! Now, if you need anything my servants will attend you. Dinner. Invite her to dinner. You will join me for dinner. That's not a request! Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man. No one says no to Gaston. Darn right. Dismissed, rejected... publicly humiliated. Why, it's more than I can bear. More beer? What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced. Who, you? Never! Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together. Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston Looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's favorite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why No... one's... Slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team They prefer to be on Ooh! No... one's... been like Gaston A kingpin like Gaston No one's got a full cleft In his chin like Gaston As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating My, what a guy, that Gaston Give five ""hurrahs!"" Give 12 ""hip-hips!"" Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips No... one... Fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston In a wrestling match, nobody bites like Gaston For there's no one as burly and brawny As you see, I've got biceps to spare Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny That's right And every last inch of me's covered with hair No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston In a spitting match, nobody spits like Gaston I'm especially good at expectorating Ptooey! Ten points for Gaston! When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Every morning to help me get large And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size of a barge No... one... Shoots like Gaston Makes those beauts like Gaston Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston I use antlers in all of my decorating My, what a guy Gaston! Help! Help! Someone help me! Maurice? Please, please! I need your help. He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon. Who? Belle. We must go. N-Not a minute to lose. Whoa! Slow down, Maurice. Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon? A beast! A horrible, monstrous beast. Is it a big beast? Huge! With a long ugly snout? Hideously ugly. And sharp, cruel fangs? Yes, yes. Will you help me? All right, old man. We'll help you out. You will? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Oh! Oh! Crazy old Maurice. He's always good for a laugh. Crazy old Maurice, hmm? Crazy old Maurice... hmm. Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking A dangerous pastime... I know But that wacky old coot is Belle's father And his sanity's only so-so Now the wheels in my head have been turning Since I looked at that loony old man See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle And right now, I'm evolving a plan If I... Yes? Then we... No! Would she...? Guess! Now I get it! Let's go! No... one... Plots like Gaston Takes cheap shots like Gaston Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston So his marriage we soon will be celebrating My, what a guy! Gaston! Will no one help me? Who is it? Mrs. Potts, dear. I thought you might like a spot of tea. But you're... you're a... Ooh! Careful. This is impossible. I know it is. But here we are. I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I? All right, Chip, now, that'll do. Slowly now. Don't spill. Thank you. Want to see me do a trick? Chip! Oops. Sorry. That was a very brave thing you did, my dear. We all think so. But I've lost my father, my dreams... everything. Cheer up, child. It'll turn out all right in the end. You'll see. Oh, listen to me. Jabbering on while there's a supper to get on the table. Chip! Bye. Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner? Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers. Ooh! How embarrassing. Ah, here we are. You'll look ravishing in this one. That's very kind of you, but... I'm not going to dinner. Oh, but you must. Dinner is served. What's taking so long? I told her to come down. Why isn't she here yet? Oh, try to be patient, sir. The girl has lost her father and her freedom, all in one day. Master, have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell? Of course I have. I'm not a fool. Good! So, you fall in love with her, she falls in love with you and poof! the spell is broken. We'll be human again by midnight. Ooh, it's not that easy, Lumiere. These things take time. But the rose has already begun to wilt. Oh, it's no use. She's so beautiful, and I'm... Well, look at me! Oh, you must help her to see past all that. I don't know how. Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable. Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman. Ah, yes. When she comes in give her a dashing, debonair smile. Come, come, show me the smile. But don't frighten the poor girl. Impress her with your rapier wit. But be gentle. Shower her with compliments. But be sincere. And above all... You must control your temper! Here she is! Good evening. Well, where is she? Who? Oh. The girl, yes. The... girl. Well, actually, she's in the process of... Circumstances being what they are... She's not coming. What?! But, Your Grace...! Your Eminence! I thought I told you to come down to dinner! I'm not hungry. You come out, or I'll... I'll... I'll break down the door! Master... I could be wrong, but that may not be the best way to win the girl's affections. Please attempt to be a gentleman. But she is being so difficult. Gently, gently. Will you come down to dinner? No. Hmm? Ah, ah, ah! Suave, genteel. It would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner. We say please. Please. No, thank you! You can't stay in there forever! Yes, I can. Fine. Then go ahead and starve! If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all. Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it? Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there is the slightest change. You can count on me, mon capitan. Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up. I ask nicely, but she refuses. Well, what does she want me to do... beg? Show me the girl. Well, the master's really not so bad once you get to know him. Why don't you give him a chance? I don't want to get to know him. I don't want to have anything to do with him! I don't want to have anything to do with him! I'm just fooling myself. She'll never see me as anything... but a monster. It's hopeless. Oh, no! Oh, yes! Oh, no! Oh, yes, yes, yes! I've been burned by you before. Zut, alors! She has emerged! Come on, Chip, into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters. Come on, Chip, into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters. But I'm not sleepy. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I work and I slave all day long and for what? A culinary masterpiece gone to waste. Oh, stop your grousing. It's been a long night for all of us. Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn. After all, he did say please. But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper he'll never break... Splendid to see you out and about, Mademoiselle. I am Cogs worth, head of the household. This is Lumiere. Enchante, cherie. If there's... Stop that! ...anything we... Please! can do to make your stay more comfortable. Ow! I am a little hungry. You are? Hear that? She's hungry. Stoke the fire. Break out the silver. Wake the china. Remember what the master said. Oh, pishposh. I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry. All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread, and then... Cogs worth, I am surprised at you. She is not a prisoner. She's our guest. We must make her feel welcome here. Right this way, Mademoiselle. Well, keep it down. If the master finds out about this it will be our necks. Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little music? Music? Ma chere mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now we invite you to relax. And now we invite you to relax. Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner. Be... our... guest Be our guest Put our service to the test Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest Soup du jour, Hot hors d'oeuvres Why, we only live to serve Try the gray stuff It's delicious Don't believe me, ask the dishes They can sing, they can dance After all, Miss, this is France And a dinner here is never second best Go on, unfold your menu Take a glance and then You'll be our guest Oui, our guest Be our guest Beef ragout, cheese souffle Pie and pudding en flambe We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks And it's all in perfect taste, that you can bet Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest... If you're stressed It's fine dining we suggest... Be our guest, be our guest Be our guest! Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving He's not whole without a soul to wait upon Get off! Ah, those good old days when we were useful Huh? Suddenly, those good old days are gone Oh! Ten years we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy You walked in and oops-a-daisy! It's a guest, it's a guest! Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed Wine's been poured, and thank the Lord I've had the napkins freshly pressed With dessert, she'll want tea And, my dear, that's fine with me While the cups do their soft-shoeing I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sake, is that a spot? Clean it up, we want the company impressed We've got a lot to do Is it one lump or two? For you, our guest She's our guest She's our guest She's our guest People, fun's over, over here, line up... It's ten years since we've had anybody here And we're obsessed With your meal, with your ease Yes, indeed, we aim to please While the candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, we'll keep going Course... by... course One by one Till you shout, ""Enough, I'm done!"" Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now, let's eat up Be our guest, be our guest Be our guest Please be our guest! Bravo! That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, Mademoiselle. Good show, wasn't it? Yes, everyone. My goodness, look at the time. Now it's off to bed, off to bed. Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now. It's my first time in an enchanted castle. Enchanted! Who said anything about the castle being enchanted? It was you, wasn't it? I figured it out for myself. I'd like to look around, if that's all right. Oh, would you like a tour? Wait a second, wait a second. I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean. Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle. Oh, well, actually, l, uh... Yes, I do. As you can see the pseudo-facade was stripped away to reveal a minimalist rococo design. Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings. This is yet another example of the late neoclassic baroque period. and, as I always say if it's not baroque, don't fix it. Uh, where was I? As you were. Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the... Uh, Mademoiselle? What's up there? Where? There? Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing. Dusty, dull, very boring. Ah, so that's the west wing. Nice going. I wonder what he's hiding up there? Hiding? The master is hiding nothing. Then it wouldn't be forbidden. Perhaps, uh, Mademoiselle would like to uh-uh, uh... see something else. We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to... maybe later. Th-The gardens or-or the-the-the-the library, perhaps. You have a library? Yes, oh, indeed. With books. Scads of books! Mountains of books! Forests of books! -Cascades! -Longboats! Swamps of books! More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime. Books on every subject ever studied, by every author who ever set pen to paper. Oh! Why did you come here? I'm... I'm sorry. I warned you never to come here. I didn't mean any harm. Do you realize what you could have done?! Please, stop. Get out! No! Get... out! Where are you going? Promise or no promise I can't stay here another minute. Oh, no, wait, please. Please wait. Oh! Oh! Here now. Oh, don't do that. Just hold still. That hurts! If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much! Well, if you hadn't have run away this wouldn't have happened! If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away! Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing! Well, you should learn to control your temper! Now hold still. This might sting a little. Hmm? By the way, thank you. For saving my life. You're welcome. I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night but he said you'd make it worth my while. Ah. I'm listening. It's like this. I've got my heart set on marrying Belle but she needs a little... persuasion. Turned him down flat. Everyone knows her father's a lunatic. He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle. Maurice is harmless. The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being locked up. Yeah. Even marry him. So you want me to throw her father into the asylum unless she agrees to marry you. Oh, that is despicable. I love it! If no one will help me then I'll go back alone. Yes, is that everything? I don't care what it takes. I'll find that castle, and somehow I'll get her out of there. Belle? Maurice? Oh, well. I guess it's not going to work after all. They have to come back sometime. And when they do, we'll be ready for them. Lefou... don't move from that spot until Belle and her father come home. But, but, I... Aw, nuts. I've never felt this way about anyone. I want to do something for her. But what? Well, there's the usual things. Flowers, chocolates. Promises you don't intend to keep. Ah, no, no. It has to be something very special. Something that sparks her interest. Wait a minute! Belle, there's something I want to show you. But first, you have to close your eyes. It's a surprise. Can I open them? No, no. Not yet. Wait here. Now can I open them? All right. Now. I can't believe it! I've never seen so many books in all my life! You-You like it? It's wonderful! Then it's yours. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, would you look at that! I knew it would work. What? What worked? It's very encouraging. Isn't this exciting? I didn't see anything. Come along, Chip. There's chores to be done in the kitchen. But what are they talking about? What's going on? Come on, Mom. There's something sweet And almost kind But he was mean, and he was coarse and unrefined And now he's dear, and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before She glanced this way I thought I saw And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked at me that way before New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be? True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him That I simply didn't see... Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul Well, who'd have known? Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own? It's so peculiar We'll wait and see A few days more There may be something there that wasn't there before... You know, perhaps there is Something there that wasn't there before What? There may be something there that wasn't there before. What's there, Mama? Shh! I'll tell you when you're older. Right, then! You all know why we're here. We have exactly 12 hours, 36 minutes and 15 seconds to create the most magical spontaneous, romantic atmosphere known to man or beast. ""Or beast..."" Right. Need I remind you that if the last petal falls from this rose the spell will never be... broken! Very well. You all know your assignments. Half of you to the west wing. Half of you to the east wing. The rest of you, come with me. Oh, lighten up, Cogs worth, and let nature take its course. It's obvious there's a spark between them. Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames. You know... a little. Besides, they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again. Ah, human again. Human again. Yes, think what that means. I'll be cooking again Be good looking again With a mademoiselle on each arm When I'm human again Only human again Poised and polished and gleaming with charm I'll be courting again Chic and sporting again Which should cause several husbands alarm Ha, ha! I'll hop down off this shelf And tout de suite be myself I can't wait to be human again When we're human again Only human again When we're knickknacks and whatnots no more When we're human again, good and human again Oh, cherie, won't it all be top drawer? I'll wear lipstick and rouge And I won't be so huge Why, I'll easily fit through that door I'll exude savoir faire I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair It's my prayer to be human again When we're human again Only human again When the world once more starts making sense I'll unwind, for a change Really? That'd be strange Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense? In a shack by the sea I'll sit back, sipping tea Let my early retirement commence Far from fools made of wax I'll get down to brass tacks and relax! When I'm human again So sweep the dust from the floor Let's let some light in the room I can feel, I can tell Someone might break the spell any day now Shine up the brass on the door Alert the dust pail and broom If it all goes as planned Our time may be at hand any day now Open the shutters, and let in some air Put these here, and put those over there Sweep up the years of sadness and tears And throw them away We'll be human again Only human again When the girl finally sets us all free Cheeks a-blooming again We're assuming again We'll resume our long lost joie de vivre We'll be playing again Holidaying again And we're praying it's ASAP We will push, we will shove They will both fall in love And we'll finally be human again... For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. Could you read it again? Well, here, why don't you read it to me? Uh, all right. Uh... Uh... I can't. You mean, you never learned? I learned... a little. It's just been so long. Well, here, I'll help you. Let's start here. Here. Okay, ""Twoe..."" ""Two."" ""Two... I knew that. Two households..."" We'll be dancing again We'll be twirling again We'll be whirling around with such ease When we're human again Only human again We'll go waltzing those old one, two, threes We'll be floating again We'll be gliding again Stepping, striding as fine as you please Like a real human does I'll be all that I was On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn And we're all Human again! Tonight is the night. I'm not sure I can do this. You don't have time to be timid. You must be bold, daring. Bold, daring. There will be music... romantic candlelight... provided by myself. And when the moment is right you confess your love. Yes, I con... l-I... No, I can't. You care for the girl, don't you? More than anything. Well, then, you must tell her. Voila! Oh, you look so... so... Stupid. Not quite the word I was looking for. Perhaps a little more off the top? Your lady awaits.

Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast. Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip. It's past your bedtime. Good night, love. Belle? Are you... happy here with me? Yes. What is it? If only I could see my father again just for a moment. I miss him so much. There is a way. This mirror will show you anything... anything you wish to see. I'd like to see my father, please. Papa? Oh, no. He's sick. He may be dying and he's all alone. Then, you must go to him. What did you say? I release you. You are no longer my prisoner. You mean... I'm free? Yes. Oh, thank you. Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way. Take it with you so you'll always have a way to look back and remember me. Thank you for understanding how much he needs me. Well, Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly. I knew you had it in you. I let her go. Yes, yes. Splen... You what? How could you do that? I had to. Yes, but... Why? Because... I love her. He did what? Yes. I'm afraid it's true. She's going away? But he was so close. After all this time, he's finally learned to love. That's it, then. That should break the spell. But it's not enough. She has to love him in return. Now it's too late. Papa! Papa! Ooh. They're back. Belle? Shh. It's all right, Papa. I'm home. I thought I'd never see you again. I missed you so much. But the Beast? Did you... how did you escape? I didn't escape, Papa. He let me go. That horrible beast? But he's different now, Papa. He's changed somehow. Hi. Oh. A stowaway. Why, hello there, little fella. Didn't think I'd see you again. Belle, why'd you go away? Don't you like us anymore? Oh, Chip, of course I do. It's just... May I help you? I've come to collect your father. My father? Don't worry, Mademoiselle. We'll take good care of him. My father's not crazy. He was raving like a lunatic. We all heard him, didn't we? No, I won't let you. Belle? Maurice, tell us again, old man. Just how big was the beast? He was... I mean, he was... he was... enormous. l-I'd say at least eight... No, more like ten feet. Well, you don't get much crazier than that. It's true, I tell you. Get him out of here. Let go of me. No! You can't do this. Poor Belle. It's a shame about your father. You know he's not crazy, Gaston. Hmm, I might be able to clear up this... little misunderstanding. lf... If what? If you marry me. What? One little word, Belle. That's all it takes. Never. Have it your way. Belle. Let go of me. My father's not crazy and I can prove it. Show me the Beast. Is it dangerous? Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone. Please, I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle. He's my friend. If I didn't know better I'd think you had feelings for this monster. He's no monster, Gaston. You are. She's as crazy as the old man. The Beast will make off with your children. -He'll come after them in the night. -No! We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall. I say we kill the Beast! We're not safe until he's dead He'll come stalking us at night Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me Through the mist, through the woods Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride Say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs, razor-sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home Till he's dead Good and dead Kill the Beast! No, I won't let you do this. If you're not with us, you're against us. Bring the old man. Get your hands off me. We can't have them running off to warn the creature. Let us out! We'll rid the village of this beast. Who's with me? Raise your torch, mount your horse Screw your courage to the sticking place We're counting on Gaston to lead the way Through the mist, through the wood Where, within a haunted castle Something's lurking that you don't see every day It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain We won't rest till he's good and deceased Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord, and here we go. We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head! I have to warn the Beast. This is all my fault. Oh, Papa, what are we going to do? Now, now. We'll think of something. Ah! We don't like what we don't understand In fact, it scares us And this monster is mysterious at least Bring your guns, bring your knives Save your children and your wives We'll save our village and our lives We'll kill the Beast! I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up. Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all. Could it be? Is it she? Sacre bleu! Invaders. Encroachers. And they have the mirror. Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them. Who's with me? Ah! Take whatever booty you can find but remember, the Beast is mine! Lights ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle Unafraid, although the danger just increased Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're 50 strong And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the Beast! -Pardon me, Master? -Leave me in peace. But, sir, the castle is under attack. Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast! This isn't working. Oh, Lumiere, we must do something. Wait, I know. What shall we do, Master? It doesn't matter now. Just let them come. Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast! Kill the Beast! Now! Yes! Here we go. What the devil? Belle, look out! You guys got to try this thing. Up here you scurvy scum! Now! Oh! And stay out! Eww! Get up. Get up! What's the matter, Beast? Too kind and gentle to fight back? No! Belle... No! Gaston, don't! Let's go, Philippe. Come on out and fight! Were you in love with her, Beast? Did you honestly think she'd want you when she had someone like me? It's over, Beast. Belle is mine! Let me go. Let me go. Please, don't hurt me. I'll do anything. Anything! Get out. Beast! Belle? Belle? You came back. You... You came back. Of course I came back. I couldn't let them... Oh, this is all my fault. If only I'd gotten here sooner. Maybe... it's better... it's better this way. Don't talk like that. You'll be all right. We're together now. Everything's going to be fine. You'll see. And... at least... I got to see you... one last time. No. No. Please... Please... Please, don't leave me. I love you. Belle. It's me. It is you. Lumiere. Cogs worth! Mrs. Potts! Look at us. Mama, Mama. My goodness. It is a miracle. L'amour. Well, Lumiere, old friend. Shall we let bygones be bygones? Of course, mon ami. I told you she would break the spell. I beg your pardon, old friend but I believe I told you. No, you didn't... I told you. You most certainly did not you pompous, paraffin-headed pea brain. En garde, you-you overgrown pocket watch. Take that. Are they going to live happily ever after, Mama? Of course, my dear. Of course. Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

In Search of the Castaways (1962) - full transcript,"In 19th century England, young Mary Grant and her brother, Robert, embark on a dangerous quest to find their missing father, a sea captain who vanished somewhere along the Chilean coast.","- Goodnight, John. - Goodnight, milord. Goodnight, milady. - Goodnight. Excuse me, sir. Is that Lord Glenarvan's yacht? - It is. - Well, we'd like to see him, please. Oh, would you, now? He'll be horribly hurt to know... you didn't arrive for the start of the party. We didn't even know about it. I bring news of one of his ships, disappeared at sea. A message from Captain Grant of the Britannia. Captain Grant? Why, he's dead, isn't he? And just how would he get a bottle where he's at? - Go on. Get on with you. - Captain Grant's our father, and he's not dead. I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother, Robert. Oh, no offence intended, miss. He was a good man, he was. The best this line ever had. It's just that it's, uh, hard to take serious. The note in the bottle, I mean. Still, l-I suppose it could happen. And that's why we just have to see his lordship before he sails. Oh, I'm sorry, miss. I've had my orders. Nobody aboard except invited guests. But we've come all the way from Plymouth today. It has cost me my last franc. And we haven't had a thing to eat. So that's it. Another trick, is it? Get out of here with your wild tales, your hard-luck stories. You almost had me taken in for a minute. Go on. Stand clear of the gate there. Come on, Robert. - Lovely. - Goodnight to you. You two, come back here! Come back, I said. You children, come here at once. - Did you hear me? - Good evening. - Come back, I said! Come back at once! - Good evening. Come out now, matey, wherever you are. You wouldn't want me to lose my bloomin' job now, would you? - How do we get past this one? - Goodnight, sir. Oh, very simple. Just walk nonchalantly... up the plank backwards. Yes, with all the confusion... he won't be able to tell you from the departing guests. Go on, now. Go on. Goodnight, sir, madam. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight, sir, madam. - Come on. - You now. Go on. Go on, go on! Goodnight, sir. Goodnight. Little boy, would you be so kind as to get my wrap for me? - I think I left it in the salon. - You children, what are you doing there? - Stop those children! - Evening. - Come back, you two! - Good evening. Good evening, sir. Come back. Stop, you two! Come on. Stop! Come back, you two. Come back! - May I give you some more turkey? - Thank you. Not too much. The salmon is delicious. I hear Lord Glenarvan is going to Venezuela again this year. Yes. He so much enjoys the seasons. How long does he plan to be away this time? He seems very proud of this new, uh, steamer. Good evening. Uh-Uh, cloves from Madagascar. It is not bad for English ham. Oh, excuse me, madam. There's someone under the table! Look! There they are! Head them off the other way. Steward! Steward! Up there on the deck! - Oh, let me go! - Why? Come back, you two! Come back! Oh, come here. Come here now, then. I got you! - I got you! - Oh, let me go! - You leave him alone! - Oh! Oh. It's you, your lordship. - Isn't it? - I daresay, but who are you? - Oh, please, your lordship, we must speak to you. - We've come all the way from Plymouth. - I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother. Our father's Captain Grant. - On the Britannia. - And he's alive. And you must send a ship to bring them back. - With two of his men. - As quick as you can. - Now, just a minute. Come along. We'll talk it over. Now, then, how do you know your father's still alive? - He put a note in a bottle. - And a French professor... - Monsieur Paganel, he found it. - Oh-Oh, that again. - What do you mean? - My dear children, ever since... I posted the reward for news of your father's ship... people have been turning up with notes they claim to have found in bottles. - How many is this, John? - Uh, 22, Father. If I had my way, every last one of the culprits would be hanged from the yardarms! Exploiting human misery, that's what it is. Nothing more vicious, more treacherous. But it is from my father. I can tell. Monsieur Paganel, show them the note you found in the bottle. Voil?. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Wr-Wrong bottle. Ah, this is the one. First question always, where'd you find the bottle? Well, y-you see, milord, l-I went fishing with some students. And I suppose you cut open a fish and found the bottle inside. Oui, oui, milord, a 220-pound shark! Osborne, throw this man off the ship before I turn him over to the police. - No, your lordship. - But it is the truth, what I tell you. Ridiculous. Why should a shark want to swallow a bottle? Oh, what was in his mind, l-l-I don't know. l-I tell you only what was in his stomach. You make a career of this, do you, exploiting children? I am Jacques Eliacin Francois Paganel. Professor of geography, Universit? of Paris. My credentials, milord. Oh! Forged, I imagine, like the note in the bottle. All right, Steward. Come along. - Oh, no, your lordship, you can't! - Monsieur Paganel's our friend. Just a minute, children. I have something to say to you. If we could be alone for a moment. Take your hands off me, messieurs. Never have I been thrown from anyplace in my life. Let's not set a precedent. My dear children, don't you think I'd be the first to respond... if I thought there was the slightest chance of finding your father... or any of his crew alive? I'd go to the ends of the earth, and that's no idle boast. The Glenarvan motto: ""Persevero"". It's been the family creed for 800 years. But it's not a hoax. I saw the note myself, and I know my father wrote it. The way he makes his letters. I can tell. Just a little more clever than the rest, that's all. When you consider the odds, it would be fantastic just finding the bottle. But this business about it being swallowed by a shark... Well, what would my father have to do? Come back here himself and say... ""Yes, I wrote the note. Now come and find me."" Did I understand you to say you came all the way from Plymouth? Tell Osborne to get cabins ready for 'em. We'll drop them off there on the way. - Very well. - But what about Monsieur Paganel? - We can't go off here and leave him. - Now, my dear, I'm only doing what's best for you. Now, then, how'd he get past you in the first place? Well, how did he get past you, if it comes to that? Now, wait a minute. Oh, here's his lordship's wine. - And about time too. - A bit late, aren't you, Charlie? It'll be a pretty rough trip if his lordship doesn't get his wine. Uh, follow me, please. This way, miss. Cabin number five on the starboard side. Of course, Richard's a lot older than you. Maybe not actually in years, but... Oh, he's been around more. I don't know what you mean by that. After all, there's probably nobody else in the world my age... who's made as many trips to the Mediterranean as I have. Well, that's just it! I mean... have you ever been to, oh, South America, for instance? As a matter of fact, no. - Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that? - It's only an ocean. Perhaps you should have waited and had breakfast with my father. He's the one who'd have to give the order to change course for South America. Oh, he would go. Nothing could stop him... if it were for something you could really believe in... and not this note in a bottle. Let me ask you something. If you were a castaway and you had a bottle... wouldn't you put a note in it and throw it into the sea? Oh, I don't think so. After all, it's such a small chance, isn't it? Well, what would you do, then? Just sit there with the empty bottle until you died or something? All right. I suppose I would try it. But I wouldn't expect someone to find it inside a shark. Well, if that's where they did find it... you wouldn't expect them to just forget about you, would you? You never saw that Frenchman before in your life... did you, until he showed up with the bottle? And yet, you believe every word he says. And no matter what he says, you and your father refuse to believe him. Suppose I told you that I'd found a bottle with a note in it. - Would you believe me? - Well, did you? - Yes. - And what did it say? It said: ""Disregard first message."" Oh, I suppose you think that's funny, don't you? You've got your father, so to you this is just a big joke. Now, wait a minute. I'm not making a joke of it. - I'm just trying to show you. - Please, do you mind? - I'll make you an offer. - What kind of an offer? I don't necessarily believe this story about the shark swallowing the bottle. But I am getting a little fed up with these infernal trips to the Mediterranean. Down, boy. Good old boy. I'll bring you a bone or something later. That's a good boy. Oh, uh, bonjour. In case you've emptied your own pockets. And just don't let any shark get this away from you. Thank you. I assure you, mademoiselle, your case shall be properly presented. After all, Father, suppose it was you cast away. Do you think I would give up if I had even the slightest clue? I'd live up to all the legends of Glenarvan. Persevere, if I had to move heaven and earth. - Why don't we try Corsica for a change? - Father, will you listen to me? - Haven't been there for years. - Suppose you were a castaway and you had a bottle. You wouldn't just sit there staring at it until you died or something, would you? You'd at least try putting a note into it. And suppose for some strange reason it did get swallowed by a shark. - Most unlikely, I'd say. - Very well, then. If you won't listen, I shall be getting off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert. - Oh, come, come, come, come. - I feel very strongly about this, Father. My dear boy, if that's the way you feel about it, let's have a look at the blasted note. - Where is it? - In the bottle. - Well, where's the bottle? - The Frenchman has it. - Confound it, where's the Frenchman? - You had him thrown off the ship in Glasgow. - That's a fine thing. When I really want something, no one takes the slightest notice. - If I happen to drop a casual remark... - Casual remark? ""Throw him off the ship before I call the police! We ought to hang him from the yardarm."" Now we're in a deuce of a fix. That Frenchman might be anywhere by now. Where's Captain Mangles? Tell Captain Mangles to... Oh! - Oui, milord? - Good gracious, the Frenchman! - I thought... - Oh, but I give you my word, I was put off the ship. Fortunately, I do not let such things upset me. The note, milord. Well, this is useless. There's practically nothing of it left. Ah, but with a little study, a little intelligence... it is possible to make out what is said. You will see one thing w-without question. Their location is given as 37 degrees... 11 minutes, southern latitude. That's no good without the longitude. Consider first, milord, on the 37th parallel... there are only a few places they could be. That's what I've always said. If Captain Grant's anywhere at all, he's in Australia. It's only logical if you know anything about shipping and commerce. Use the head, milord. The note makes reference to being captured, no? And you can make out the word ""Indian"" or ""Indians"". So where on the 37th parallel would they be captured by Indians? - Australia, of course! - Aboriginals, yes. Indians, no. By George! I've got it. South America. Couldn't be anywhere else. And if he was captured by Indians, he'd be on the West Coast. It's a matter of simple logic, monsieur. We'll go there and follow the 37th parallel over the Andes... until we find Captain Grant. Osborne, find Captain Mangles! Tell him I'm going to change course. - Thank you, milord! Thank you! - Oh! - Now, just a minute. Don't forget that it was me who arranged... - Thank you! - Thank you, milord! - Thank you, milord! Oh, please! I'm an Englishman, you know. There, milord, is where we must go. The pass of Antuco. Then follow the parallel until we find Captain Grant. Ha, jolly good trick to throw a bottle into the ocean from up there, I must say. Ah, but could he not put the bottle into a river? And would it not flow down to the sea, eh? No, no. Grimpons. - Grimpons. - That means ""let's climb"". It is the French recipe for the good life. Whatever you want to do, don't be afraid to do it for fear of failure. Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain - Let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb, let's climb - Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb And if we fall, crash, bang And die a terrible death Never mind, we've had thejoy thejoy of the climb Oh, don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb Oh, look! Look! Straight down that valley there. - Where? - Do you see it, milord? A river into which one might throw a bottle. - By Jove, yes! - And an Indian village. I'd say, this could be just the place, couldn't it? Have a look, my dear. Better make camp here tonight and get an early start in the morning. Hey, you, make camp. Stay here tonight. - No stay. - Huh? - What's the fellow talking about? - Ah, it is not Spanish. It must be a local Indian term. Hey, hey, hey. What means trango peeray? Oh, l-l-l-l-I think he-he wants to tell us... it gets, uh, terribly cold up here. Oh, we build a fire, no matter how cold. No matter how trango peeray, we stay in hut. - No stay. - Listen to me. I tell you when to go and when to stay. - No stay. - We stay here tonight! - You stay. We go. - Don't you dare to try and tell me! I think the fellow really means it. Well, that's done it. Without the horses, we're helpless. - We'll never make it. - Well, can't we still go on on foot? But of course, mademoiselle. The Araucanians have... crossed these mountains on foot for hundreds of years. - Even drive their sheep. - Oh, good! - When do we start? - We're not gonna start. I'm not gonna go leaping about like a... like a confounded mountain sheep, thank you. - Oh, please, your lordship, please! - No, no, mademoiselle. Uh, he's right. Uh-Uh-Uh, we-we'll, uh, return to the ship with the Indians... and get some crewmen who are younger. - Age has got nothing whatever to do with it. - I'll take over and lead the-the expedition. You-You-You can remain in your deck chair. You lead the way? Ridiculous! Have the whole lot of you lost in no time. On the other hand, with me in command... it would take a great deal more than, ha, trango peeray to turn us back. - That's right, isn't it? - Right, your lordship. Monsieur Paganel, do you think we might have one tonight? When you are in the poultry yard, it is a good time to wish you catch the egg. See? Look at this. See? Any slight tremor of the earth, and it starts to swing. But if you're asleep, how could you tell? Oh, maybe all night I sleep, uh, with one eye open. Perhaps his lordship will sleep better... if we do not tell him before tomorrow... what trango peeray means, eh? Your pleasure, mademoiselle. Castaway, castaway Trust in your star You know I will find you Wherever you are Though all your dreams May be tossed by the tide Cling to your hopes Never cast them aside Castaway, castaway Though you may be Lost in the wilderness Over the sea I will discover Your castaway shore Then you'll Be a castaway No more You'll be A castaway No more It's my father's favourite. E-Ever since I was a little girl, I've always thought it sad. Not the way you sang it. Oh, it's just the way I feel tonight, I suppose. Oh, it's all so exciting. We're up here. Father's down there. The stars pointing the way. It's almost like being in heaven. - I know. - Ah, there you are, my boy. Better get some sleep, you know. Got an early start. - We're too excited to sleep. - Mm, so I see. You'd better come along with me, just the same. Wait. I want to make a wish on that star. What could you wish for that you haven't got? That my father would go somewhere and get lost. Just for a little while, you understand. - What on earth are you doing? - This is to wake me up. - Wake you up? - Yes, in case... - In case what? - Oh, nothing. - And what is this, may I ask? - My watch, milord. Perhaps I want to look at it during the night. How very peculiar. Oh, Robert, really. Do put those things away. But if there's an earthquake, I want to be sure and see it. Earthquake? Who said anything about an earthquake? Oh, I'm so stupid, milord. I didn't realize it until later. The Indian, when he did, uh-uh-uh, that, you see? He did not mean it was cold. No. He meant trango peeray... earthquake! - This is the land of many earthquakes. - Gracious me. In the whole world, no place has such big... such beautiful, such magnificent earthquakes as right here. But it is one chance in a million we should be so fortunate. Yes. Yes. Yes, of course. Quite right. Besides, this place looks as if it's been here for hundreds of years. Doesn't it? I mean, uh, it's safe to assume... that it will last one more night, eh? - Oui, monsieur? - Oui, milord. And I'll wake you up if one comes, your lordship. - It worked! - Oh, Robert, do be quiet. An earthquake of the first magnitude. I say, do you have to shake the whole place? By Jove, it's an earthquake! Outside, everybody! Oh! Oh, magnificent! This is an experience that makes our entire expedition worthwhile. By Jove, that was a narrow squeak! Oh! I say, this is getting rather dangerous. Then we attempt to change course. Everybody to port. - It worked! - That's better. Much obliged. - Look out! Look out! - This way, everybody, quick! To the port, quick! - What the... Port, quickly! - No, starboard! - Port, I say! - Starboard! Where are we going now? - Perfect timing. - Oh! - Abandon ship! - No! Wait! - There's a hole in the ice! - But we don't know where it goes. We'll soon find out. Alpine-type glacier. Drift minimum. We'll never get out of here alive. The ice melts and gets out. Why can't we? - Isn't it beautiful! - Oh! They'll never believe us when we get home. If we get home. Look out, everybody! Duck! Where... Where're we going now? Ooh. Try starboard, I tell you! - This is most peculiar. - Look out! - That was close. - Oh! Come on! - Where's Robert? - Here's his hat. Robert! Robert, can you hear me? Not down there. I'm up here. Oh, a giant condor. A Sarcohamphus gryphus. Robert, hold on! I don't have to. She won't let go. This is true. She will not let go until she reaches her nest. - Reaches her nest? - Yes, high in the mountains. No doubt she has little ones that must... Hang on, Robert. We're coming! - Robert! - I got dizzy coming down... but it was a jolly good view from up there. - Oh, thank goodness you're all right. - I wonder who fired the shot. Perhaps he did. A Patagonian. Magnificent! It's like turning back the history book hundreds of years. Hope he's not dangerous. Permit me. l-I've learned a few primitive words. Anyway, even if you don't understand... l-I want to thank you for saving my brother's life. - Happy could do. - Heavens, he speaks English. First-class shooting, sir. First time, right through the heart. No. Shoot through heart... bird go limp, drop small boy. But shoot back of head... bird go stiff, wings go up. He circle down, land boy safe. Y-You mean, you-you purposely... i-induced motor paralysis through damage on the medulla? - Not understand. - Neither do I. - Can you tell us where our father is? - He was captured by Indians. - On the 37th parallel. They were kidnapped, washed up on the shore, captured. Three white men. Indians hold them for ransom money. - You very slow to come. - Are they all right? Last time I hear, they are well, but very tired of being prisoners. Just a minute. What do you mean, ""last time you hear""? Don't you come from the village where they're held? No. I'm an Araucanian chief, Thalcave. My people do not rob, do not steal, do not hold prisoners for ransom. - Well, where are they? - Far away, at the foot of the mountain. Great plain reaches far as you can see. - Many days to cross. - The pampas. Well, couldn't you take us there? First we stop at my village for horses and supplies... then Thalcave will try help you find them. Much rain there. You sleep in tree. May come flood. Flood? By George, that's a good one. A giant ombu tree, Phytolacca dioica. - Magnificent specimen. - Oh, please, may we sleep in it? You can sleep where you like, but I certainly don't intend to roost... in a tree like a confounded sparrow. Pitch my tent just here. You in tree, listen! Flood come. Much water. You stay in tree. I bring help. - My father? - I wake him. To be safe, we tie things so they do not fall. Flood come. You go quick to tree. I ride for help. Not even raining. Just like on a ship. Make ready for the storm. Look! The flood! - Father! Father! - John, be careful! - Father, hurry up! Come with me! - Now what's going on? Can't a fellow get a decent night's rest in this place? - Come on, Father! - Oh! Come on. They've got it! Hold on! Highly irregular, flood like this... and not even raining. With some food in your stomach, milord, the world will feel a lot brighter. - Oh! Look out below! - Oh! Sorry, milord.

Enjoy it. - We're travellers on life's highway Enjoy the trip Each lovely twist and byway each bump and dip - Good. - If there's a complication - Enjoy it - Enjoy it You've got imagination, employ it Employ it From eggs and herbs au naturel Omelette ombu a la Paganel Pour vous, milord Enjoy it Voil?! Robert, can you see anything... that looks like an Indian on horseback coming to our rescue? - Only some birds. - Only some... Only gone down half an inch in two days. We'll be here for ten years at this rate. Cheer up, milord. We pay no rent. Mother Nature sets the table for us. And, fortunately, we have plenty of water. That's very fortunate, I must say. - Very fortunate. - My father will never trust another Indian. But Thalcave's different. He said, ""I bring help"". - And he will. - If he got through. Don't even think such things. All right. But if I may paraphrase... what a wise young girl once said to me many years ago: ""If you were marooned in an ombu tree... and you had some logs and something to tie them into a raft... you wouldn't just sit there until you died or something, would you?"" That's very good. For a girl, I mean. I suppose most girls are taught embroidery and things. But Mother died after Robert was born. And Father, being a sea captain... When we first met, I had a different impression. Most girls can be rather silly. Do you know what I mean? - No, I don't. - Well, you're different. - How different? - I don't know how to say it. I had it all worked out last night. Sounds rather silly now, though. - What does? - Well, you don't expect things of a girl, certain things... like climbing mountains, going through floods, making the most of it. You know what I mean? Don't think I do. Well, I want to say that... I think you've been just fine, for a girl. Oh, what I really mean is that if we get out of here alive... and when we're old enough... - John! - Mary! There's the log you've needed for your raft. That's it, just what we need. Perfect! Got it. - Oh! - Keep out of the way! - It's a tiger! - No, no, it's a jaguar. Felis onca. Get that beast out of here! It's probably as frightened of us as we are of it. - Just a big cat, milord. - Well, get rid of it. Get rid of it. Can't stand cats at the best of times. Confounded things always make me sneeze. Go on! Get out of here! - Go on! Get out! - Don't, John! The poor thing. Do not move, not an eyelash. ""Marooned in ombu tree. Latitude, 37 degrees south. Longitude, 66 degrees west. Send help immediately."" One, two... three, four, five... six, seven. More than two kilometers away. My father always told me, never go near a tree in a thunderstorm. One, two, three... four, five. I think it's getting closer. Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade... sound travels at approximately... one... Great heavens, the tree's on fire. Look! We'll beat it out. No time for that sort of thing. Get out of the way! You see? It's too late now. The oil in the ombu tree, milord, it has a remarkably low flashpoint. - Onto the raft. It's our only chance. - Look out! Oh, no! - I'll get it. - No, don't! Apparently, we have our choice: eaten raw down there... or roasted alive up here. Hold on, everybody. Mother Nature comes to our rescue. A waterspout! Ahoy! Ahoy! We're still several degrees off course, you know. Hurry up with the canvas. There's a breeze coming up. Aye, aye, Captain! You're strangely quiet, aren't you? - Sorry, milord. I was thinking. - I don't know which is worse, by George: having you so happy you sing all the time, or so glum you won't even talk. ""The ombu tree is gorgeous. Enjoy it."" Huh. I am stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I know, but that hasn't worried you till now. - It is better they do not hear. - Better they don't hear? What are you talking about? It is something I remembered in the night. - How could I be so stupid? I don't know, but the shark I caught... - Land ho! with the bottle, it was a mako shark. - It... - Ahoy! And as well as I know anything in the world, I should know that the mako shark lives only in... Be quiet! Ahoy there! Ahoy. Ahoy there! I think I see it. There. - A canoe! - Ahoy there! Aho... Good heavens. It's an Indian war canoe. This is a fine fix. We're completely unarmed. - It's Thalcave! He did come back! - What? Thalca... Ho-ho. Thalcave, my good man. Delighted to see you. - I bring news. - News? What kind of news? You come in canoe. We go fast to village... where they hold prisoners, three sailor men. Three sailor me... Oh, monsieur, we've found them! It's like a miracle. Thank you, my lordship! Thank you! Oh, I say, I say. Careful. Come along. Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful. You're a welcome sight, sir, believe me. Is this thing safe? Forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight... forty-nine, fifty. Oh, now it's come, I can hardly believe it. - We're saved! - We're saved! Stop it! Stop it! Who the devil are these people? Where's Captain Grant? These not right men? It's all my fault. How could I be so stupid? It's what I started to tell you, milord, about the mako shark. - What about the blasted thing? - It lives only in and around the Indian Ocean. That's what the-the word ""Indian"" means in the note... not that they were captured by Indians. If you knew this, why didn't you tell me before I paid out all that money? I kept hoping, milord, that maybe somehow I could be wrong. This can mean only one thing: Captain Grant is in Australia. Australia? That's where I wanted to go in the first place... only, I was stupid enough to let you talk me out of it. Oh, my dear children, I'm so sorry it all had to end like this. Listen! Thalcave speak. For many years, my people hunt... trail game many miles. Sometimes sneak up, but game not there. But Indian knows if game not there... it somewhere else. Keep looking; otherwise, Indian die out many years ago. ""Keep looking."" He's right, you know. Now we know where Captain Grant really is. And by Jove, we'll go and find him. Oh, thank you, Thalcave. Thank you. - How does she look to you? - Just what we need. - Ain't a ship hereabouts could overhaul her. - What about the steam? - We can learn. - The old man wants to know what happened to the Britannia. - Maybe I should tell him. - You're not serious, now, are ya? Maybe I should tell him. The very spot, your lordship, where she sank beneath the waves. Now, it's me own dear brother who lost his life... tryin' to put out in a small boat to save some of the crew. - It was shockin'. - All right, Osborne. Pay 'em off. - Very good, milord. - Thank you, lordship. Much... Much obliged. - I don't wanna see any more. - Very good, milord. Look at that! Ridiculous! Preposterous! How can the same ship go down in a dozen different places, sometimes 500 miles apart? Answer me that. Ah, confounded wharf rats! Lie to you, take your money, cut your throat if you give 'em half a chance. How the dickens can I tell where to start, eh? What do you want? - Mr Frederick Ayrton to see you, milord. - I told you I didn't want to see anybody else. - This is a gentleman, your lordship. - I do hope I haven't arrived at an awkward moment. I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner. I would've warned you not to offer a reward. - Well, as a matter of... - I'm afraid you'll find very little integrity... among some of the men who frequent our waterfront. And it so happens that I have the very information you require. - About my father? - Ah, so this is the daughter of Captain Grant. Well, if I can reunite this delightful child and her gallant father... that is the reward I'm interested in. Were you ever in Plymouth? Plymouth, England? No, I haven't had that pleasure. May I inquire, sir, as to the nature of your information? Oh, well, two years ago, I was caught in a violent storm in the Tasman Sea. We picked up a poor fellow, badly battered and half drowned... - just off the coast of New Zealand. - New Zealand? He said he was from the Britannia, and that she'd gone down with all hands. He died during the night, and our ship combed the area the following day. You know, until I read that piece in the paper about the message... in the bottle, I had no idea that there were any survivors. But why wasn't the sinking reported when you reached your destination? Well, I assumed that it was. I was only a passenger on the ship, you know. Heavens. If he landed in New Zealand, he must've been captured by the Maoris. I'll report this to the authorities at once. Osborne! - I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that. - Why ever not? You haven't had my experience in dealing with our colonial government. Eventually, you learn to get along in spite of them. They talk endlessly, and they need authorization from London. You'll be lucky if they're ready in a year. But anything could happen to him in a year. What do you suggest? Oh, l-I can't afford to get mixed up in this. I've told you all that I know, and... and I've got my own estates to run. Sir, the lives of three men are at stake. I'd like to speak to this gentleman alone, please. The trouble is, New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean. There is something strange, very strange. I don't care what it is. I've seen that man before. - Oh, you're just imagining it. - No, I'm not. Anyway, I can't stand people who look at me like that. ""Delightful child, gallant father."" Perhaps it's a good sign that neither of you take to him... because it seems that everything else that you've welcomed with open arms... has turned out dead wrong. Please understand I don't wish to do anything against the law. - Oh, certainly not. - But at the same time, I don't intend... to leave Captain Grant in the hands of those bloodthirsty cannibals. So, uh, I appeal to you as a man with experience... and knowledge of local conditions to help us before it's too late. All right. I'll gather up some men who know the Maoris... and who can handle any kind of situation. By Jove, you mean we just, uh, go in and have it out with them? Oh, good heavens, no. We'll take along some supplies to barter... and then if Captain Grant and his men are still alive, we'll buy them back. Capital idea. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. - I need hardly remind you that we must be discreet about what we plan to do. - Ooh, of course, of course. - Don't want to be tied down by a lot of confounded red tape, do we? - No. Just my son John and Captain Mangles. Otherwise, not a word to a soul. Yes, just as it should be. Get this crate down in the hull, would ya, lads? Motley looking lot of fellows you've got together. Well, when you look for men to go into Maori country... you don't choose them from among the socially elite. Jolly well put. But I must say, I didn't realize you'd require quite so much merchandise. Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone when one could impress the natives with a handful of coloured beads. And if they choose to sell their prisoners dearly... we'd better be prepared. I see. John, you've got to tell me. What's going on out there? Ah, mademoiselle, you are far too beautiful... in the new gown to worry your pretty little head about such things. But what's in all those boxes? I would've thought if my father wanted you to know, he would've told you. Every man out there looks like a fugitive from the penal colony. John, you've got to do something. Don't let this man make a fool of your father. Just because he calls you ""a delightful child"" and you don't like it... you think he's trying to make a fool of my father. It is better that we think it, monsieur, than to give him the opportunity to prove it. All right. Let me tell you something, both of you. Maybe my father huffs and puffs a little bit, and we've all smiled at him just in fun. But I don't think anybody's going to make a fool of him quite as easily as... well, certain people I could name. And now, if you'll excuse me. Patience, dear. We shall see what we shall see. I'll wager she's faster than any ship in the Royal Navy. Good. You know, I'd say that... steam was the coming thing if it weren't all so complicated to handle. Well, you don't have to complicate it. Actually, it's quite simple. - Yes? - Pardon, milord. Uh-Uh, Could I talk... to you sometime before too long? - Certainly. What about? - No matter how much I think about it, it is always the same. Captain Grant is in Australia. There is no possible way the note could mean he's in New Zealand. Oh, my dear fellow, don't worry about that beastly note. Mr Ayrton knows precisely where the Britannia went down, don't you? - Of course. - Milord, I'd be the happiest man... in the world if it turns out that once again, I'm wrong. - I've no doubt you will be. - If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to see the engine room. Oh, my dear fellow, delighted. Take you around myself. I think you'll find there's nothing complicated about steam. It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it, let bygones be bygones? Now that we're at sea, I can let you in on our secret, if you're interested. Those boxes you were wondering about. Would you like to know what's in them? Trinkets. Trade goods. They're for barter with the Maoris so that we can buy your father's freedom. - Who told you this? - Mr Ayrton. - And you believed him? - All right, Miss Suspicious. If it'll make you more companionable, I'll take you below and show you. Well, here you are. All right, Pandora. Which box do you want me to open? - That one. - You sure you don't have a guilty feeling? After all, it is rather like spying on someone... especially when they've gone out of their way to be so nice to you. - Open it. - I will. Nothing is too much trouble if it satisfies your curiosity. Voil?, mademoiselle. ""Trade goods. Trinkets"", he said. So that's his game. He's using my father's ship as a gunrunner. Pity you did that. Wilcox, down here! We've got to warn the others. I'll lead them off, then you make for the door. - There he is! - I see him! - Ooh! Oh! - Now, is that a nice way to behave... when we're taking you to meet your father? Come on. Make no noise. Just stop the paddles. Anything else, and I'll shoot. Ever been to New Zealand before? Yes. Twice. Do as I tell you, and perhaps you'll live to make it three times. - We're stopping. - That is most strange. - Raise the hands quietly. - Do as he says, Robert. Help! Pirates! Lord Glenarvan, help! Come quickly! Lord Glenarvan, help! Pirates! Lord Glenarvan! I thought I heard the boy call for help. You did. Now, give me that gun, and no harm will come to him. Wait. I say, you can't put us out there without oars. It's not human. Oh, the current will carry you to the shore, if that's any consolation... but I'm afraid we'll have to keep your crew on board... until they've taught us the fine points of using steam. We're unaccustomed to such luxuries in the South Pacific. - You'll pay for this. - You've got it backwards, old man. We have been paid for it, and quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchie. You promised you would be the happiest man in the world... if you were wrong about Captain Grant being in Australia. And you were. Brown and Riley, lay aloft and stand by to make sail. - Aye, aye, sir. - You were in Plymouth! My father signed you on the day he sailed. As third mate. What a memory. You'll hang for this, you know. I'll see to it personally. I'll make a full report to the admiralty. You do that. And here's a bottle to put it in. Let's hope it isn't swallowed by a shark. Lower away! You'll never get away with this. That's what Captain Grant said when we put him over the side... at this very spot with his two rather foolishly loyal mates. If you're lucky, you might all end up in the same stewpot. If anyone is interested, I might explain. It is the influence of the west wind drift... playing against the east Australian current... that might drive us right up onto the shore. Yes, yes, yes. That's the second of my ships he's got. First the Britannia, and now my beautiful new steam yacht. It's all clear now. It was a mutiny. There's no reason why I should lie about it. My father was set adrift here... Then he must be a prisoner of the Maoris. What did he mean, we might all end up in the same stewpot? Not to change the subject, but our reception committee seems to be waiting. Maoris, hundreds of'em. Deuce of a fix. No trinkets to bargain with. What have we got to offer, huh? Just us, I suppose. - Good gracious! - You come as a stranger, and I take ye in. I have prepared a place for thee in the presence of thine enemy. - It's all right, my dear. I'm sure he's harmless. - What think ye now? I be crazy, eh? Not a bit of it. I be smart. Mark ye well the words of old Bill Gaye. Bill Gaye! Weren't you the mate on my father's ship? Depends entirely who your father was. What was his ship? And who you be, for that matter? You see, I be smart. Makes a difference who she is. I'm Mary Grant. My father's Captain Grant of the Britannia. Well, why didn't you say so before? Fine ship, she was. I walked her decks across the seven seas. Woe be onto thee, oh, Moab, for thy sons are taken captive. - Who is he? - Fantastic, he seems to be the mate from the Britannia. Do you know where he is? Can you tell me? Where is Captain Grant? Have you no eyes? Can you not see? - He's gone. - Where? Same as before. Diane's Inlet. - Did the Maoris take him? - He be smart too. He learns the way to keep alive, for they need him when they get more guns. Guns? Then it must be Ayrton. Aye, that's who it be. Somehow the devil has got another ship. - Were there three of you? - Aye, three of us there were. Captain Grant, McNabb and old Bill Gaye... against Ayrton and all of his mutinous crew. - The scoundrel! - Bonjour, Monsieur. My father, Captain Grant... Did he and McNabb go together to Diane's Inlet? Nay, my child. I say unto you: McNabb, he was not smart. He was caught when he tried to escape. Odd devil. - What's he laughing at? - For this, child, I have prayed. And the Lord has granted my petition, which I asked of Him. This is the night the Lord hath given us our salvation. What think ye? Could a man force himself through there... even a man who has gone without food to make himself as thin as a man can be? Nay. I say unto you, it is impossible. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. Robert, do you think you could crawl through there? Maybe if I tried very hard. - You be smart too. - Even if he could, what good would it do? I'll show ye now. The Lord helps them that helps themselves. Two years we took to make it, from the hairs of our heads... from the garments we wore, from a thousand things we gathered. Absolutely preposterous. What could the boy possibly do all by himself? There be more to it than that, for this be the night of the haka. Bide ye your time till the night be well begun... and the horns sound and the flames leap upward... and the devil hath seized the souls of our captors. Then I will show the way. - Nobody's looking. Now's your chance. - Right. Up you go. Up. - It looks awfully small. - Go on. Go on! I'm stuck. Let out all the air. Pardon my soul, I don't know which is worse: a crazy man... who thinks he's smart or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid. - Hold that. - Oh! Ooh-ooh! Now, to get the pendulum swinging. Oh, do be careful! Lower away. I have the unhappy feeling we're going out of the frying pan into the fire. He can't get over! The rope's not long enough! Lower away! - He still can't do it. - Go on! Lower away! That's all there is! Then let her go! He did it! Tie that down there. Go down it. Go. Bye. - Deuce of a fix this is. - Off we go to the mountain. We'll never outrun these fellas. By Jove, I never saw a rope burn like that. Gunpowder. It's woven in like a fuse. Aye, what say ye? Who be'st smart now? ""Vengeance is mine. I will repay"", said the Lord. Father, come on! If this is the sacred volcano of the taboo, they dare not follow. You know of such things, even though you be a stranger? Aye. I be smart too. Aye. We be two of a kind. - By Jove, they've stopped. - What think ye now of old Bill Gaye? Be he crazy or be he smart? They dare not set foot here, for all this is taboo. I say, that's splendid, isn't it? - But they're moving on again! - A slight miscalculation, milord. - I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano. - Just as I thought. - Out of the frying pan, into the fire. - Don't worry, milord. Come help, please! - What are you planning to do? - Uncork the bottle and let the genie free. Oh, I've got it! Everybody, push! - Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million. - At the university, milord... I'm considered the wizard of the croquet court. Come ye, where we'll be safe. - Oh, it's horrible! - Have no fear, mademoiselle. The Maoris can run faster than the lava. Enjoy it! And now, Mr Gaye, to Captain Grant. Aye, to Captain Grant! Follow Bill Gaye! He's got it all planned out! All right, Grant. Tell them there are six more boxes... nearly 200 rifles still in the hold. I'll send the whole lot ashore as soon as they hand over the money. And how do I know the rest are as good as this one? - I give you my word. - That's what you offered last time... when you unloaded a pile of junk. Now, really, Grant. Every time I do something charitable, I live to regret it. Like putting you ashore alive. And I intend to stay alive by not recommending rifles I haven't examined. My beautiful, beautiful yacht. If they've done anything to damage her... I'll have them strung up by their thumbs. How did you know where she was going to be? This be where they always unload: in Diane's Inlet. In Diane's Inlet? Oh! In the note, what I thought said ""Indian"" was really... Oh! I'm stupid, stupid, stupid! Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may turn out to be of divine inspiration. Mr Gaye, I thought we were going to find Father? We be. We be. Look ye now. It's Father! He looks well, thank goodness. - They're all getting into boats. - They're comin' here. We have but little time to prepare our reception. - I come to see thy ship. - No one can come aboard. Surely ye be not afraid of old Bill Gaye? - Bill Gaye? - ""The hoary head is a crown of glory."" Know ye not that? - How many do you want, Lucky? - That'll do. How many cards do you want? - So where's mine? - I gave you them. What a hand here. Right. How do we get past him? Excuse me, sir, but is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht? Well, sonny, I guess... Here. Wait a minute. Ain't you the boy that's with that lot? Come back here! - Your lordship. - We haven't got the keys, Captain. We'll have to break the door down best we can. - Put out your decks, gentlemen. - I'm busted. - See if Thompson'll play. He's got money. - Yeah. All right. - Your deal, Bob. - Right. Here you are. Riley, come here quick! - The brig! - The brig! Know ye not what the Good Book says? ""He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it""? Send him over to me. Ooh, got him! Quick. I suppose we'll have to open every box. Put the best ones on top. Ayrton, you scoundrel! Don't move. You may live long enough to hang. Hello, Glenarvan. Welcome aboard. Well, here we are. This makes us even, doesn't it, uh? You've got your ship back, and I'm bringing you Captain Grant... so, uh, why don't we, uh... Captain, take him below with the rest of the scoundrels. Aye, ye've sown the wind... and I say to you, you shall reap the whirlwind. Back, you dogs! Back, I say! Bill Gaye! What on earth... - Father! - Mary! Robert! You think I be crazy, don't ye? See now, how are the mighty fallen. - How on earth did you find me out here? - Monsieur Paganel. - He's a French professor. - He found a note in a bottle. - Lord Glenarvan took us on his yacht. - And we've been all around the world looking for you. - South America. - And we were captured by Maoris. - Maoris! My dear children. Oh, how I've prayed for this day. - I was beginning to give up hope that I'd ever see you again. - I must be catching a cold. And now you're suddenly here, and I'm able to hold you both close in my arms. I can't find words to express my gratitude to all of you. We would've been here months earlier if I hadn't been so stupid about the note. - The note? - Yes. The-The note in-in the bottle. The note in the bottle? What think ye now? It was I put that note in the bottle. And put the bottle in the sea. ""Cast thy bread on the waters... for thou shall find it after many days."" But they seemed so sure it was their father's handwriting. - It was, wasn't it? - Now you know my secret... why I ran away to sea. The voice is the voice of a God-fearing man... but the hands are the hands of a forger. - Oh, my word! - Bill, you scoundrel! Just think. If he hadn't put the note in the bottle... and if Monsieur Paganel hadn't caught that shark... And if you hadn't tried to slap my face that morning on the way to Plymouth... I wouldn't have talked my father into making this trip. - Funny how things work out, isn't it? - Isn't it? Here we are, all of us together. All of us. Did you ever see so many stars? Once, on top of a mountain. Did you know that down there, out of the light, you can see the Southern Cross? Southern Cross? So, that's my little girl. By george, they do grow up. Uh-Uh, I was just thinking to myself. No matter where you are in the world... it is always different, but it is always the same. In English, you would say... ""All climates are the same for love."" There it is. The Southern Cross.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/In_Search_of_the_Castaways-56095
The She-Butterfly (1973) - full transcript,"A young man wants to marry the beautiful daughter of a landowner who refuses to allow the marriage. To prove his worth, the young man becomes a miller in a vampire-infested local mill.","The Moth Vule! O! Vule! -Who is it? It's me, Zivan. Ok, ok. Just a moment. You're here. - Indeed. Well, well. I just took a little nap. It's hard to resist. Listening to this noise all the time.... So the council has ended? -Ended. So what happened? There were a bunch of people. -Really? -Really. Shoo, God damn thee, shoo! So, when should I come back? - It will be done by the morning, Master Zivan. So, you're sleeping here? - I am. Alone? -Alone. Aren't you afraid? No. Why, should I be? Master Zivan, isn't that your daughter, Radojka? Yes, that's her. Beautiful, like a butterfly. Drop dead, damn you! Vule! Oh, Vule! Let's go in. Everyone! Everyone! Everyone! Why the racket? Vule is dead. What did you say? -Dead... dead! Who's dead? Vule is. So, he as well... Strahinja, you frightened me! -And where have you been all day? I was right here. Zivan announced I'm free for marriage. Again? -I swear! I wish you hadn't told me that. Oh, but how could I not? What did he say? Eh, you know him. I was herding sheep above the water-mill, gazing into the river... And I wanted to dive in to it, to drown in it. Run, run, he's here! Run Strahinja, please! Why should I run? Go, I am begging of you! What are you doing here? - I followed the flock... Go back home! Remember, if I see you here again, you won't ever leave! Poor Vule. - God bless his soul. He's the third. - No, he's the fourth! Four millers, in only one year... Sava is back, I say. He's back. - And just when we thought he had settled down. We have so little peace... - May God damn this evil beseeching us... People, don't listen to these bedtime stories. There is no Sava Savanovic, and there are no vampires! We should think about what to do with the mill. I hear you all, whining like old wives. Don't you see that we are left without bread? No evil to be had. No vukodlaks to be wary of. And Vule? How exactly did he died? How? Like any other dead man. His time had come, so he died. And now what? Should we leave our wheat to rot because of him and this madness?! True, you have a point. We can't live without the mill! We are barely managing with lack of wheat! Listen, my fellow men and dearest brothers. Let's summon our courage, face our fears, and sleep there for a couple of nights. Come on, who is with me? I say, brothers: we should try again once more. Let's find another miller! Oh, but just who will be this new miller? Nobody wants to do it! Maybe if we had a true priest,his prayers would work and we could use him! Are you talking about Sredoje? The one always fooling around? I may be in jest at times, but when I work, I am not just some liar pretending to look useful. Good thing you aren't working now, or I might have believed that! Keep your hands away from me, holy man! Come on. Good day, Master Zivan. I said ""good day"" to you! What do you want? Master Zivan, I am here to ask for your daughter's hand. Oh, really? Who are you asking for? For me, who else? I couldn't begin to guess. You've really decided to marry, eh? I did. - With Radojka, you say? With Radojka. And where will you take her to live, to that shack? It was a good home to my mother; it will be fine for my wife, too. And how will you feed your wife? Why are you asking me that? I may be poor, but I'm healthy, I will work! Well, what are you waiting for? I'm waiting for you to give me an answer! Then you'll be waiting for quite some time. That's fine, I'm in no hurry. Then you wait till you are dead. If it's come to this, then I need to tell you something, Master Zivan. If you won't give me your blessing, then I will take her without it! Get lost! You're beyond reasoning with! Know this: if you ever return to my home, I'll give sense a new way into that skull of yours! You have decided for good? I was thinking about it. There is no other option. And the house? - I don't care. Nay, what do I need a house for? A place wherein to grow dust? A place to be miserable in? But where will you go? - I know not... Somewhere, far away... What am I to do? You? Could you really just leave me like that? Why? Should I stay, just to watch you get married to some other man? I'm going to Podsavina. I'll manage, somehow. It's better than to stay here. What do I have here? Nothing. And what will happen to me... You will be married soon enough... Who knows which man you will belong to... Oh, Radojka! The time has come to decide what to do. Break it down! What is he saying? - To destroy the mill and build another. No, brothers, why would we do that?! Let's knock it to the ground! Knock your wife to the ground! Fuck you! Stop it! Stop, stop! Don't be like that. Oh, Strahinja! Where are you going? Come here with us men. I cannot, I am in a hurry. Nonsense! Forgo your work, if just or a bit, and drink with us! Where have you been? - At home. Come, come. Rest yourself for a spell. It's empty. Oh my, it certainly is! A moment, please. What is going on here? Are you holding council? I'm afraid so. We are in grave trouble... Why? We don't have a miller now. But Vule, wasn't he the miller? Vule... is dead. Murdered, by the look of it. Dead? - God bless his soul. And now, dear Sale, we can't find another miller. It is a dreary trouble. Such a big village; only one water-mill, and no one to run it. Here it is, Sale, my boy. I haven't seen you in quite some time. You know, we love you like you were our own son. Sale, dearest... dearest... would you be our miller? Would you help us in our time of need? Help us, brother! Our children are hungry and without their bread. Why me? We beseech you! If you don't help us, we will have to grind the wheat with our bare teeth! All right, I'll do it. But only for so long. I will need money. I'm preparing for the road. Well, sonny, God bless you! Haven't I always said that our Strahinja is twice the man we wish to be! Come on people, in the name of that, let's drink! Come on Strahinja, drink. Come on, go in! Come in, you first! - You come. Ok I will. Oh Strahinja! Oh how unfortunate... To cry for... -Don't cry, let's us rather gather up what is left here. Yeah. - Come on, let's go. Is that you, Strahinja? It is I. In the name of God, you're alive? Alive, yes. Tell us, what happened last night? Was it him? - It was him. Sava Savanovic? Hey, hey, I told you people... But did you see him with your own two eyes, eh? In the name of the Father and the Son. God save us... - God is with us... What a miracle! People, did any of you know Sava Savanovic? We only know where his grave is. - Who could possibly know him, he died more than a century ago... I know of one who can tell us something about this! - Who? The old woman, Mirjanicka. I bet she knows. I doubt she can tell us about this, I doubt anyone can. Come on. Come, come here. Please , you ask her. - No, not me... I'll ask, if no one else will. Granny Mirjana! Louder, louder! Oh, granny Mirjana!! You can do better. I can't do better. Do it better! - Wait, I'll try. Why are you yelling? Granny, do you know anything about Sava Savanovic?? Where are you from, sonny? We are from the council of Zaroshje! Nice, nice. Do you know about Sava Savanovic? Come on granny, do you know about Sava Savanovic!? Sava Savanovic? I don't know anything dear, I swear. So much about that... Sava, you say? I know Sava. He was ugly. Where is his grave? What did you say? I said: where is his grave? His grave! The grave! Where is it? Whose grave? Sava's grave!!! Oooh, Sava's grave! I don't know dear, I swear. This is going nowhere. Sava's grave, you say? It's right there! Where? Over there a ways, near a ditch. Under an elm tree. What a waste of time... All this walking nearly killed me. Brothers, why are we doing this? It's pointless, all of this. That's what you get when you do what an old hag says! - Listen to this! We will need a horse for the proceedings. Old man, why didn't you tell us that before? First, we need to find a stallion. Then we should prepare a stake, and holy water. Who has a stallion in our village? - Zivan, he's the only one. That bastard? He won't give it to us. God bless you, brother. You're resting, eh? Why are you here? I had some work to do with Mirjanicka. Asking the old woman about Sava Savanovic, is it? No, no. Wait, how did you know? You're worse than a bunch of children. Hunting vukodlaks. Shame on you, grown men... Brother, don't you have a horse - a stallion? I have. Why do you ask? I need it to breed with my mare. There, in the barn. Take him. DOOM DOOM Brother, why did you refuse that man? Who? Strahinja. Did I? You did. Why don't you give him the girl? - Brother, if you came to ask me this, please go. The gate is there. Who slept in the mill last night? Djemo, but don't lead him. Let him lead. - If you think you know better, you do it then. Wait, wait. Brothers, look what has happened to us, we are letting the horse lead the people! It's better to follow a horse, than a fool. I'm staying here. Me too. Shut up! What's wrong? Is it the grave? It is the grave! All right, start digging. It's here. - Keep digging? Continue. More, more. Hold this. Prayer! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit! Amen. [Reading prayer in old Slavic] Priest, watch for the butterfly. Now! Just go on..! Priest, holy water, quickly! Pour it! Here it is, catch it, catch it! God damn it, why did you let it go! We lost the butterfly... Why don't you get up NOW, hahah! Welcome, granny. - God bless you. Priest, cheers! It went dry, huh? - Yeah. Dry. Hey, he won't give her up? He won't. But why? Because I am poor. He said ""I won't let her live in that stitch house."" He said that? - He did. You're unlucky... It's okay, Cjeba. Every man in this village would gladly give you his daughter. Am I right? And that bastard won't even hear it out! The man is really in love, he left home and everything because of this girl. He's not even Radojka's father; is he an uncle or something? Who knows if they are related at all... Don't be crazy, Strahinja. If Radojka loves you, just take her! Stop it, Cjeba... I know what to do. I'll come with you! Who else? - I will! Stop, people, stop. Ask the priest first; don't rush into sin. It's not a sin to steal the girl, not in this situation, right? Sure, sure. He is a decent man. Sure, sure. And to... sleep with her? Sure, sure. If it's not sinning, I'm going, too! Radojka! Oh, Radojka! Who is it?! - It's me, Strahinja, don't be afraid. What do you want? To run away with you! Oh Strahinja, how could I? Don't be afraid. Come on, come on, what are you doing? Congratulations, brother, I wish you both to be happy! Get up, he's gonna get you! I'm staying; let him get me. Here's to lasting many years! - Here is our true husband. Thank God, in one day we got a hero and a miller! Good luck to you. What a beautiful dress, and such hair! Nice, very nice... So you didn't leave? I did not. Why didn't you? Just because... If you are going to leave me again, you shouldn't have returned. I'll never leave you, never! I swear! You'll see, motherf**kers.... For the love of God, enough.... A nice husband you are, here, take some! People, I suggest these two men to be the godfathers! I have nothing against that. And granny Milenija should protect the girl tonight. Protect her from who? Well, that's the tradition. Everything by the order. That's how it is. The Devil never sleeps. - So, you don't get ideas at night... And tomorrow morning, we'll head straight to church. Hope that priest won't be too drunk to do the wedding. Are you going to be alone tonight? Alone. Can I come? You can. Rado, dear... My little chicken. Oh granny Milanija, did you protect the girl? Hey birds, get up, the priest is here! That's enough, leave something for tonight.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/The_She-Butterfly-200800
Hero (2007) - full transcript,"Kohei Kuryu returns to Tokyo and reunites with his former colleagues.

It's got something for everyone, doesn't it? No way! - Good munchies. - Yeah. Beware of hard kernels, Chief. Smells good. Mine's shrimp flavored. Strawberry. Want some? Don't mind if I do. Ow! Where's Shibayama? In court. Really? Can anyone blame her? Her husband is neglectful... repeatedly unfaithful. You would be fed up, too. Objection. Let's see. You were in Okinawa, then Sapporo and then...? Yamaguchi. Beautiful coastline. Lucky you. What brings you back? Yeah, how long's it been? - Six long years. - ""Long""? Next, First Elimination Round, Group 3. Couples No. 17, 18... 20, 21, 23... Smile. Smile. The tango. - Relax those shoulders! - You can do it! - Looking good! - Go No. 20! Now they're grinning. Hold that pose! Got it! Don't forget us! There was never any malice intended by ""the husband"". As ""his"" wife, she should've understood that. Stop using the 3rd person tense. Stop saying ""his"". This is about you. Don't divorce me. Ryoko. It's over. Are you all right? He turned an ankle on that jump. Pathetic. Only 30 seconds in. It's over. The Justice Minister has ordered Tokyo D.A. S to halt investigations... of ex-Transport Minister Hanaoka for an alleged bribery scandal. Say what? So your fiance... cheated on you while you were in New York studying English. He betrayed me. You were away quite a while. Six long years! ""Long""? Don't you think taking a brick to his head was excessive? He only needed two stitches. That's plenty. I'm doing the questioning here. Sorry. This marks only the second use of such judicial authority... going back to a shipbuilding scandal 53 years ago in 1954. You beat him silly just for bumping into you? I'm sorry. Is that an admission? Yes. - Don't be so easy. - Unlike some. Ouch. My lead broke. Sorry. What for? You apologetic types! Don't let it bug you. Through the Prosecutor General, the Justice Minister... can assume control of investigations brought by district prosecutors. Why would you do something like this? I was lonely. So you set bicycle seats on fire? That's called ""arson"". I wanted attention. Hold on. I need my deputy here. What's he doing? Mr. Suetsugu? That's his name. Mr. Suetsugu! Clear the way! The Justice Minister intervened saying that the investigations... were becoming a ""witch hunt"", based on insufficient grounds. I'm sorry I fell. What possessed you to jump all of a sudden? I don't know. It just felt like something I had to do. To work. Of course. The move has sent shock waves through D.A. Offlces. With the investigation stalled... Tokyo branches are being described as ""in turmoil"". ""Turmoil""? My blood pressure won't drop. Updates to follow... Morning. Good morning. I sense anger. It's all in your mind. You're different. In six years, a racehorse goes from colt to stud. Things change. You a horse? Good morning! Morning. Morning. Is your leg better? No. Hold the door. Mr. Suetsugu? You're too close. Sorry. Watch those crutches. Excuse me. She's still angry. You're stepping on my foot. Big feet. Testy today, Shibayama? Divorce court. Stop coming to watch. But it's fun. You want to stay married that badly, huh? Bad vibes. I'll say. I'll bring you coffee, Chief. Make it a good day, everybody! - Make me a cup, too? - Yes, I know. Do me a favor, Endo. Tidy up the place. - Quickly. - What's with you? Kuryu! You want me? It's Shibayama's case but would you handle the trial? Manslaughter. What? Mr. Keisuke Umebayashi. He's admitted his guilt. It's a no-brainer case. But Shibayama's all tied up with his divorce. He's worried about losing his daughter. Will you do it? Okay. Really? Great. Good luck. Hi, Sweetie. It's Papa. Who's that? Don't hang up! The defendant buys cigarettes and returns to his car. Just then the victim walks by. They bump shoulders. Don't really step on them! You wearing perfume? Yes, why? You never did before. Now I do. Okay, shoulders bump. They argue. Defendant grows violent. A right hook to the face, then a kick to the gut. Victim falls, striking his head on the curb. That would be enough to kill a person. Friend of yours? No. The victim was on his way to see his fiancee. - So we go, too? - Absolutely. Briefcase. I should really put that away. But I can't bring myself to do it. I never imagined he'd be gone. Why'd this have to happen? It's my job to expose the truth. Don't worry, ma'am. The defendant, Umebayashi, has already confessed to the crime. Yes, his lawyer was very kind. His lawyer came here? Today's featured item! It sheds inches off your waist and doesn't take up any space! It's the amazing ""Jiggle Wheel""! Straight from Korea to your midsection! Amamiya? If I remember correctly... didn't you follow Kuryu all the way to Okinawa? No! I was going there anyway. You also sat next to each other at a World Cup match. That was sheer coincidence. Come on. What're you suggesting? I haven't seen him in six years. Six years! Well, I've seen you everyday for the past six years. But I still don't even have... your email address. What would we email each other about, Mr. Egami? Lots. Thanks for the meal. Things like weekend plans. I know! We could try just calling each other! Good night. Hey. - What're you always listening to? - None of your business. I guess not. What? I'll see her safely home. Do you... have a twin brother in, say, Yamaguchi Prefecture? Forget I asked. ""Courthouse"" All rise. The defendant then kicked the victim to the ground... leading to the victim sustaining severe cerebral contusions... which eventually proved fatal. Defendant is charged with manslaughter, penal code 205. Defendant, do you admit to these charges against you? What is your response? I do not. I have done nothing wrong. The prosecutor is lying. Counselor's opinion? I confer with the defendant. We plead not guilty. Takuya Kimura as Kohei Kuryu Takako Matsu as Maiko Amamiya Nene Otsuka as Misuzu Nakamura Hiroshi Abe as Mitsugu Shibayama Masanobu Katsumura as Tatsuo Egami Fumiyo Kohinata as Takayuki Suetsugu Norito Yashima as Kenji Endo Takuzo Kadono as Yutaka Ushimaru Kiyoshi Kodama as Toshimitsu Nabeshima ""Not guilty""? But he confessed. - Who's his attorney? - Man named ""Gamo"". Kazuomi Gamo? Know him? He's famous. Harvard Law. Former prosecutor. Specialist in ""not guilty"" verdicts. You're kidding. Did you sense his aura? Why this case, though? Well, did you? He's destroyed careers. Really? What about his aura? Representative Hanaoka sends his best. Thank you. We've managed to stall the investigation. But a guilty verdict in the Umeayashi case could really hurt him. I understand. Your client has confessed to everything. That's how he's managed to survive. Gamo? Deputy Chief. Working any cases? A small one. Small? You? It was September 10th, around 9 p.m. A fire broke out in the neighborhood so I went to have a look. What did you see? An argument between a man and a blonde-haired youth. Go on. The blonde-haired man suddenly attacked the man... punching and knocking him down with a kick. What did he do next? He got in his car, made a U-turn and drove off. Is that man in this room now? It's him. I'd never forget his hair. Thank you, ma'am. No further questions. Counselor? You saw the defendant at the scene of the incident? Yes. Really? I did. This is a natrium light, same as the streetlamps at the scene. Can we darken the room for an experiment? Experiment? Sustained. This was the lighting at the scene that evening. Tell me, ma'am. What color does this wig appear? Blonde. Honestly? Yes. You sure? Yes. Just like his? Yes, exactly. Why? Perhaps it was just an assumption. Turn on the lights. The testimony is specious. Objection. The witness' identification is based on facial recognition as well. That, too, is specious. The defendant was miles away at the time of the incident... working as a security guard in Akasaka. The defendant's stated whereabouts that evening are a matter of record. ""Around 8:30, I left work when I realized I'd forgotten my cell phone."" ""I parked my car near my home and went to buy cigarettes."" ""That's when Mr. Satoyama bumped me."" ""We argued, things got heated and I lost control.'' ""After I knocked him down, he became motlonless.'' ""I panicked and rushed back to work."" That was a forced confession. Forced? The defendant never left his post at work. The questioning prosecutor harassed him into admitting guilt. The reason being that... the prosecutor was under duress from his own divorce trial. Did you force his confession? Even knowing he had an alibi? I'm insulted you'd even think I'd do that. Right, Endo? You might have. You launched your pencil tip into his forehead, remember? No way! Looked painful. Not on purpose. Maybe he didn't think so. I did NOT force a confession! At least you listen to me. Well, of course. I... Stop stalling and tell me every place you torched! A icycle seat in Aobadai, September 3rd. That's number seven. I'll tell you more tomorrow. Please extend my detention. This is the pits. Kuryu's trial, my trial. Why does she suddenly want to split up? Shall I testify on your behalf? ""He's a devoted family man."" ""He races home every night by midnight..."" ""leaving me all alone in a hotel room."" Not funny. No kidding. You've some nerve crying to me about your divorce. - Have you seen Shibayama? - No. Seen Kuryu? Must be calling home from the toilet again. Mr. Kuryu? Where are you? Nowhere. But I'm heading to the crime scene again. This isn't it. Smelled a lot different. Whoa. These all smell too sweet. Look at all these. Wait, I think I found it. Gotcha! Mr. Kuryu! You haven't reported in! Bingo! What? Police report. There! What're you looking for? The width is? Another mark! Cool. What made that? ""Manly Spirit"" A van this big couldn't make a clean U-turn here. With this van... he'd have to make a 3-point turn. Unless... he was in a hurry to get away. And drove over the curb. If his van has the right kind of scratches... We can prove Umebayashi was here! But he had his car demolished the very next day. Demolished? We did accept a van that read ""Manly Spirit"" on it. Let's see now. There. Those were cars? Perfect destruction of evidence. Mind if I look? You won't even find the van, much less scratches! How do you know? Mr. Kuryu, wait! He's at the scrap yard. He's searching for a vehicle. Good answer! Reporter? Not the type. You've used the telephone. Two ""lifelines"" left! Wrong answer. Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Special Investigation Department - See our reflection? - That's impossible. Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Special Investigation Department Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Special Investigation Department - See! - In this window, yeah. - See! - In this window, yeah. Superintendent Mayuzumi. How do you do? I'm Kuryu. Swank conference room. What do you want? Information. You guys are like our ""spy division"", right? What's the deal with the Umebayashi case? Don't keep us in the dark. Mr. Kuryu here has the right to know. Fine. I'll tell you. Really? You're sworn to secrecy. Know the Hanaoka scandal? Hanaoka? It's been shelved. As ex-Transport Minister, he took a hefty bribe from a construction firm. How's that related? It took place at a fancy restaurant in Kagurazaka. But when we questioned him... he insisted he'd been at the dentist's that night in Akasaka. Takashima Dental Clinic. His dentist backs the alibi. But there's one more. A part-time security guard confirms he saw Hanaoka... in the building. Umebayashi. The bribe supposedly took place on September 10th? The 10th. Around 9 p.m. The time of the murder! A key alibi for Hanaoka is on trial for a murder 5 miles away. That would mean... Hanaoka is lying. They made Umebayashi an alibi without knowing what he'd done. Precisely. Hanaoka's secretary, Oyabu, put him up to it. A lot of bigwigs go to that dentist. In exchange for pricey implants, he protects his patient's secrecy. The front entrance is closed at night. Meaning? There's a security guard at the service entrance. They needed another witness. Umebayashi must've thought the police had come. That they'd arrest him. I was on duty. Umebayashi had no choice. And it gave him an alibi. Keep your mouth shut. Hanaoka was in the clear. But then the police did arrive to arrest Umebayashi. That's when Oyabu realized the mess he'd created. To protect his boss, he needed Umebayashi to go free. That's where Gamo comes in. Doubtlessly hired for an obscene amount. Hanaoka may have gotten the Justice Minister to stop our investigation. But he had no control over this. Now his fate rests with Gamo. Do you get it now? If Umebayashi is found guilty, Hanaoka's alibi crumbles. That'll force the Justice Minister to reopen the investigation. Your case is Hanaoka's Achilles heel. Do what you have to. But find Umebayashi guilty. You've crossed paths with Hanaoka before. That case in Yamaguchi? We're looking for a black van. Roger! Carte blanche, huh? David and Goliath. Wow. Leave it to me. I can find anything! Taking down Hanaoka will earn me my daughter's respect. Why tell me? Cut yourself? It's nothing. Don't act so tough. I'll get you a bandage. Thanks. Careful! Those D.A. S are back. Looking for a car. I told them we demolished it. What if they find out the truth? Hold it! Stop! He's hiding something! Get him! We just want to talk! Stop running! Let's talk! Okay, okay! I'm sorry! Don't hurt me! I'm sorry!! What do you mean you're sorry? I'm sorry. Where's the van? Where? Illegally exported? It's a crooked scrap yard. Where to? Korea. Korea, huh? I'll handle it. The Foreign Ministry can request local help in... I'll just go. He's going to Korea. I'll go, too. You can't. Just the two of you? You okay? Sorry. Do you speak any Korean? Leave it to me. I only know ""hello"". Kuryu, wait! For heaven's sake. Don't go. Korea? To look for a car. Kuryu's always ignoring protocol. Then let me arrange things with prosecutors there. Korea? That's correct. To look for a car? Yes. Korea? But why? They must be getting desperate. Who's the D.A. In charge? Kohei Kuryu. - Kohei Kuryu. - Yes. Shouldn't we be going first to the local D. A? They're expecting us. Their chief is Kang Min Woo, age 36... a fast-tracking elite. Aha! I hear he's a ""hunk"". What're you doing? This place comes highly recommended. We're not tourists! I didn't know that was your thing. What? ""Hunk"" attorneys. His name is Kang. Let's call him. Again? Look, he won't answer. The buyer of ""Manly Spirit"" lives up there. His name? Lim Hyun Chul. I've prepared some Korean phrases. ""I love automobiles""? It's to put him at ease. ""We love kimchee."" To make a good impression. Think it'll work? Race you! We're here. Are you Mr. Lim? (What do you want?) What'd he say? I don't know. Just wing it. We came all the way from Japan... and up these stairs. We love automobiles! Please show us your automobile. We really love kimchee. It worked! Wow! (Don't let him escape!) (So... ) (who are you?) Hurry and answer him! ""Pusan District Attorney's Office"" A drug smuggling ring? Mr. Lim? Yes, but he got away. We were just looking for a car. No one's blaming you. We're getting some real dirty looks here. I can see that. We spoiled your raid. If only we'd gotten his client data. Where's the ""hunk"" D. A? Where's Chief Kang? Looking for Lim. He hasn't got time for you. We just want to find this car. This car's been disposed of. Disposed of? Where? ""Hanaoka Alibi a Killer?"" Who leaked this? Special Prosecutors. Don't worry. It won't affect the outcome of the trial. ""Hanaoka Bribery Scandal Resurfaces"" My phone. Sorry. Egami here. The Keisei Times! Gee, I don't know. I really shouldn't be commenting on the scandal. Men's Spa? Careful! We're taking it from here. Scandal Unit here. Stop that! Hi, Sweetie, it's daddy. See the front page? I'll make you so proud... Stop calling! It's not here. No luck. If it ain't here, you won't find it. We'll look elsewhere. Move out. Move out. Move out. (They're relentless.) (Why me?) (Because you speak Japanese.) She doesn't know. (Thank you.) Thank you. Not again. (Have you seen this vehicle?) No. Mr. Kim! Over here! Give me a break. He hasn't seen it. Is this mullet? It's bass. No luck. Mr. Kim! How do you say that again? God help me. On the house. Thank you. Mix it up? (We've been searching non-stop for three days.) (Exhausted?) (They're killing me.) Excuse me! Sorry but... whatchamacallit? Mr. Kim! Stop slacking. It's got large Japanese characters! (I've reached my limit.) (Help me out here.) (I'm up to my neck, too.) (Can't you reshuffle your? Hello?) Wait up. How long you plan to stick by him? Until the end. I am his aide, after all. (You can report back here tomorrow.) (But those two haven't given up yet.) (What'll they do for a translator?) Cheongguk-jang soup? You have it? Yes! Finally! Enjoying yourself? Hey, meal time is down time. I've never had fun on vacation. Sure you have. Like being left alone on a beach in Okinawa. Just baking in the sun, shoulders especially. I was investigating a squid thief. You've drunk enough. I'm not bitter, though. Even after being stood up at the World Cup. The Okinawa branch was short on staff. Don't rehash that now. - Then silence for 6 years. - You didn't call, either. Why's it up to me to call? Why's it up to me? I took the trouble to fly to Okinawa! So you are bitter. - Let bygones be... - (Toilet!) What a jerk! Oh, she said ""toilet"". This is handy. ""You're too kind."" Excuse me. ""This attorney's a bit different""? ""But..."" ""I believe him to be..."" ""extremely capable and honest."" ""To Prosecutor Kuryu..."" ""it doesn't matter how minor the case..."" ""he always gives it everything he's got."" ""He is..."" ""someone who..."" ""you can count upon to never give up."" (I hate kimchee.) (Where's the USB stick?) Yes! (Thank you!) Amamiya! Ms. Amamiya! (Get out.) Kuryu! (Hurry.) (Recognize me?) What were you doing? (Make it easy on yourself.) Not advisale. (Keep cool.) Fine, come on! It's all right. It's over. You're safe. Ow, a cramp! You okay? The sea's polluted enough. It's too conspicuous for smuggling drugs. Lim confessed to this? Chief Kang ""persuaded"" him. Kuryu, look! Finally found it. (Careful with that! No scratches, you hear?) (He's matured on the job.) (Thanks to you.) Your notebook! (You left it in the restaurant.) Thank you! Thank you. (Oh, yeah.) (Don't let her go.) What'd he say? No idea. The outcome could lead to reopened investigations... of a high-ranking politician accused of accepting bribes. The damage to this curb, along with scratches on the vehicle... show a hasty U-turn by the defendant. I submit this as evidence it was his vehicle fleeing from the site. Objection. How do we know the scratches were made then? They could be from a U-turn made previously. Touch?. The evidence is insufficient. Vehicle scratches alone cannot warrant a conviction. Unless the prosecutor wishes to ignore the basic rule of law. A defendant is innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution bears the burden to prove... beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of a crime. Prosecution, rebuttal? No, Sir. Nit-picking! Hair-splitting! Aren't you angry? You have to admit he's right. The defense is under no obligation to prove innocence. It's up to the prosecution to prove he's guilty. Just like he said. I gotta pee. Go on without me. Megumi! Are you all right? You big oaf! Are you bruised? Let's get you out of here. Excuse us. Counselor. Nice work finding the car. Yes, well, next is to prove Umebayashi was in it. I'll do my best. What made you quit as D. A? You probably see it as the noblest of legal professions. But it has also wrongfully convicted many a man. I grew tired of an organization where owning up to a mistake meant... jeopardizing your career. I'm not the career type. One doesn't mess with Mr. Hanaoka. Mr. Hanaoka? Isn't this the Umebayashi trial? C'mon, you testing me? It's been real rewarding being in court with you. If you'll excuse e. Nature calls. Thank you. Need some ice? I'll be fine. Don't worry. I put the wedding dress away. Mr. Kuryu left those things here. He arrives each morning with odd items. And gets very excited explaining their uses. But then he grows quiet when I talk about my fianc?. Mr. Kuryu's an odd man. Ha! My lucky day! Mr. Kuryu! It's been a while. You gotta tell me when you change your contacts. So you're ""spud girl""? Hey... you're starting to look like an attorney. I am? How's he doing? Better. But they found the cancer too late. He hasn't been told. Hello. In here. He's been waiting for you. Mr. Kuryu! Nice to see you again, Mr. Takita. Here, I had to suggle this in. Four-leaf clover. Welcome back. Umebayashi's report again? How often must you read it? Quiet. You've been to Megumi's. Acting without e again? It's outside work hours. How do you really feel? About what? I wonder if you would've filed a suit like this. Why's that? 'Cause I've never seen you so under the gun. I would have. Mr. Shibayama felt sure that the case was justified. Granted, his personal life is in shambles... but he's still a professional. If I didn't trust his judgment, I couldn't stand in court. You're on the prosecuting team? No cameras, please! Can we get a coment on the case? The demise of tyrants begins with one chink in the armor. We're not afraid. That's how Rome fell. We'll blow the lid off the Hanaoka scandal. That's enough. Who called me the ""beauty prosecutor""? Nobody. I' no movie star. What's the key to this case? No comment, I guess. Sorry. I don't know. You think I should've gone with my usual glasses? No. They look great. Uh-huh. What happened? Did your wife get her divorce? Endo? Want a noogie? You're joking, right? What's that? Serious? Ow! No, you need an appointment! Where's Kuryu's office? Mr. Mayuzumi! How're you doing? I need you to hand over all material on the Umebayashi case. We can't risk losing this. I've asked the chief D.A. To let us take over. 'Scuse me? No. You guys go after corruption, not manslaughter. You don't know how. What? We deal in thefts and murders every day. Leave this to Kuryu. You just want the attention. But this is a high-level, political corruption case. No! It is not. It's about the tragic death of a hard-working citizen. Would the bereaved want the case tried as a platfor for something else? Don't twist things. I can't give you the material. Mr. Kuryu is not in court to try a politician. I beg you to leave. But he's committed a heinous crime! What could be worse... than killing a man and running? You're all nuts. What? Kohei Kuryu? You said you've met him before. Yes, over an incident in Mr. Hanaoka's home district. In Yamaguchi? A company manager stabbing of a blackmailer. Kuryu got this crazy idea that Mr. Hanaoka was somehow behind it. It was the most absurd thing. Umebayashi's case began with his own confession. But there's no supporting evidence. We just have to prove that he was there. Well, good night. Good night. What's with Shibayama? Suddenly, he's a saint. And we're evil? No, that would be Hanaoka. Good night. ""Freelance Journalist Stabbed in Yamaguchi"" ""Kohei Kuryu"" ""Defendant Takita"" ""Representative Hanaoka"" Morning. Out like a light. You're still here? And still no luck. You haven't slept at all? Time to get to work. Room needs tidying up. Let's get that arson in here. Sure. I'll make coffee. Thanks! What's with that arson? He's dragging out his confession. Really? He set over 20 bicycle seats on fire. Could be a fetish. Fire was mentioned. When? Early in the case. By Umebayashi? No, no, no. The lady witness! She mentioned one. That's right. Our arson did set a bike on fire that night. It spread to a vacant house. Where? Near Mishuku. Mishuku? Move this. That's pretty close to the scene. When was the fire reported? Around 8:30 p.m. That's the fire she saw, then. So what? If Umebayashi drove from the dentist clinic to his home... he no doubt would've taken this road here... which runs through Mishuku. Sounds about right. What was it like? A major scene. Traffic was congested. He could've stopped to look. Yeah. But we can't prove that. Nope. Maybe we can. You said the fire... was arson? Yes. Then there'd be photos. Yes! Make some coffee. No time! Photos! I don't understand. During a string of arson fires, police take photos of onlookers. Most arsons like to stay and watch the fire. Umebayashi may be in one. There's hundreds of people here. Come on. Now he's joined them. Like finding a needle in a haystack. They won't get my help. My eyes hurt. I' nodding off. Found him! Where? No. Shiny hair! That's not him! That's an old guy with gray hair. Really? His hair shines against the fire. Let's finish this. It's distracting me. Misuzu! Thanks! No blondes, no blondes. Endo! I'm a ""Where's Waldo?"" pro. Thank you. Good boy. Mr. Egami? I suppose you want my help. Don't force yourself. We're fine here. Don't mind us. Thanks, anyway. - Go on home. - What? A blonde! Let me join you, please! They'll screw this up. Don't like them much, huh? I'll be right back. Well, it was a good idea. Darn it. There's gotta be a way to expose his false alibi. That investigator's back. What's all this? We were looking for Umebayashi. But no luck. This is your idea of an investigation? It feels great! Hanaoka is as slippery as they coe. But I vowed to catch him this time. You don't know how badly I need you to win. Yes, but I'm not after Hanaoka. I know. What's that? Might come in handy in court. If you ask me, you'll need to aim much higher to win. What? ""Deposition Renzaburo Hanaoka"" It is now 8:30, half an hour before the incident. Umebayashi leaves his post. Go get some sleep. I can't. I'm your aide. Not exactly. - How so? - What? - So? - So wait right here. Wait here. Got it? How so? The 4th floor dentist is the only office open late. The 3rd floor lights are on. Bell Housing staff are all gone by 9. After that, it's only dental patients. Thank you. No way. Don't fall asleep out here. This is why I told you to go home. Whoa there! I don't believe this. - Finished? - Finished! Got plans? Not really. - Let's grab a bite. - Again? ""Bell Housing"" 'Sweet dreams.' This is separate case data from Special Investigations... containing a statement by the defendant saying... he met a certain person at the Naiki Bldg. In Akasaka at 9 p.m. That night. He should be able to confirm the veracity of the defendant's alibi. I wish to call Mr. Renzaburo Hanaoka as a witness at the next hearing. Your Honor, he is the defendant's alibi witness. Not a witness for the prosecution. If he stands to aid in the defendant's case, why not? Your Honor. He may prove to be a key witness in this trial. I believe he can clarify what really happened. You see? He's really after Mr. Hanaokal Kuryu has been targeting him ever since Yamaguchi! If he fails to appear in court... he can be brought in by force. Kuryu hasn't changed a bit. Ms. Misuzu? Taking on big-time lawyers... and now an ex-minister. Failure this time won't result in a simple transfer. You were happy to see him return. Six years you waited. No I didn't. You're wearing perfue. You should be there for him. He needs you, too. That's right. You just dove in. On impulse. I wondered what the water was like. And then an Okinawan snapper floated by my face. Rare treat. Beautiful ocean. Did you catch anything? Not a bite. You said to use watermelon as bait. Well, it takes more than that. The fish saw right through me. No doubt. Thanks. Time's up. Thanks for coming. I'll be back. I read the news. About the trial. If I'm to blame, I must apologize. For what? For getting you involved with Hanaoka over my petty quarrel. Not at all. Look, don't worry. Despite what the papers say, I'm only interested in y case. Very well. Hurry and get better... so you can prove if watermelon can really catch fish. Mr. Kuryu... could you give a message to the people back home? I'd like my ashes scattered over that ocean. This cancer is a tough customer. The truth is... I just wanted to say goodbye. It's strange, though. I'm not afraid to die. I'll see my wife again. Understood. It'll be nice... spending eternity with her in that gorgeous sea. She was... everything to me. Do you... have soeone like that? Yes. I'm glad. Then again... she's a bit stiff and officious. And way too guarded. Like a hard-boiled egg. An egg, huh? I wish I could've met her. Of course. A cell phone camera. Someone may have snapped our man. There's a chance. Shall we? Let's look. Okay. Hi. Where is everybody? Searching for cell phone photos. Cell phone? Attagirl. Hey, hold it! Afternoon. This place sends me back. Can I help you? I hadn't answered your question. A prosecutor must face a defendant with the whole of his being. That was my belief. But in reality... there were just too many cases to prosecute each day. Before I knew it, it had all become so routine. At that rate, a wrong conviction was bound to happen. That's why you gave up being a prosecutor? Perhaps you could answer a question of mine. Most prosecutors try to stay clear of me. But you said you found this all rewarding. What did you mean? Well... I didn't want a quick trial. I wanted to thoroughly show how serious this was. So there'd be no doubt in anyone's mind. Particularly in the mind of Umebayashi. I want a guilty defendant to realize the weight of his crime... and the suffering of the bereaved. That's my job. Otherwise, he serves time only to repeat his mistake later. That's why. So bring it on. Put me through the ringer. You sure are different. Am I? Thanks for the coffee. Good day, Sir. This may not be as easy as I expected. I figured on a quick victory. We get to see you at your best. What do you think would've become of me if I'd stayed a prosecutor? The Gamo I knew would've gone on to do great work. Shall we go? I think I'll stay a bit longer. Well, good night. Hundreds have lined up to see Representative Hanaoka... take the stand in court. No photos? Thank you. Well... shall we continue? Thank you. A huge crowd has turned out hoping to get a seat in court... where former Transport Minister Hanaoka will appear as a witness. In fact, he's an alibi for a private security guard... who faces charges of manslaughter. Well, I'm off. Kuryu... he may be a powerful man. But he's still just a witness. Treat him as such. I will. If it doesn't work out, I'll exile you to a pretty place again. How about Shikoku? See ya. - Later. - Good luck. Is this you? You took photos of a fire? I erased the. You idiot! Forget him. - Umebayashi? - 'Fraid not. Don't stand so close! Thank you. Call in the witness. Name and occupation? Renzaburo Hanaoka, Lower House representative. You are to speak the truth and only the truth or face charges of perjury. You reserve the right to silence to avoid self-incrimination. Understood? Yes. Any more? Is this him? No. How about him? Definitely not. Really? Where were you on the night of September 10th, around 9 p. M? At the Takashima Dental Clinic in Akasaka, having a cavity filled. Did you go alone? I drove myself there, yes. Your car? Yes. How did you enter the building? I parked in the lot and entered from the rear service entry. On the right is a security guard room, correct? Did you see the guard on duty? Yes. Is he in this court room? That young man there. These are from the 10th? Okay, next. I can't see. - Move. - Sorry. You there! I'm tripping over your feet. I got a blonde woman. Check her out. Real cute! Next! Ugh. Mr. Hanaoka... do you know what this man is being tried for? Manslaughter. Correct. It occurred in Setagaya Ward. But you saw this man in Minato Ward on that day at the time of the crime. If that is true, then this man is innocent. If I can help save a man being tried for a crime he did not commit... I am only too glad to do so. Are we done? Alost. Any luck? Sorry. Anyone else? That's everybody. - So we're done? - Yes. Hold it! There's one more! You were investigated by district prosecutors on suspicion of... receiving a million dollars in bribes from a construction company. Irrelevant to the case! Silence in the gallery. What about it? You've denied being at a restaurant in Kagurazaka on that same night... where this bribe allegedly took place. The defendant supports that claim... saying he saw you at the dental clinic. That's because he did. Yet your two stories don't quite mesh. You said you arrived in your own car. And parked in the building lot. Yeah, so? In an open space? Yes. What's your point? That's odd. The defendant says he drove his own car to work. A black van. So it should've been there. There are spaces there. See for yourself. I have. In the day, there are four spaces open. But at night, 3 vans from the realtor copany return from their rounds. When you arrived, the defendant's van... should've been parked in the last available space. Where on that lot did you park? Order in the court! The witness will answer. I parked in an available space. That would mean the defendant wasn't there. Perhaps you saw another guard. What? Mr. Hanaoka... there's one slot. Either you or the defendant was in that building. Or perhaps... neither of you were. Do something! I see your true motive. You're hoping to use these proceedings to incriminate me. After I went to the trouble to appear in this little trial. Such insult no longer warrants y response. I reserve my right to silence. Don't delude yourself. When I want you, it'll be at your trial. We're here to find the truth to a murder case. A case of which you actually know very little about outside of... what your secretary has told you. Must I know? Yes. Everyone in this room must know. At 8:40 p.m. On Sept. 10th... Yuichiro Satoyama left his office and headed for a jewelry store. He went to pick up rings he had ordered for his upcoming wedding. He put the rings in his bag and called his fianc?e, Megumi. They planned to meet to discuss the big day. Mr. Satoyama was heading toward the street, perhaps, to hail a taxi... where he bumped into a man. And accidentally stepped on the man's dropped cigarettes. Now this man showed no traces of alcohol or drugs. But the man suddenly struck Mr. Satoyama with his fist. Mr. Satoyama's nose was broken. The man then kicked Mr. Satoyama in the abdomen... sending him hard to the ground. The back of Mr. Satoyama's head struck a concrete curb. The assailant fled the scene. A woman, Setsuko Kashiwagi, witnessed the incident. An ambulance arrived 10 inutes later. Mr. Satoyama's heart stopped once in the ambulance. He reached the hospital 22 minutes after the witness' call. Four doctors and 7 nurses worked to save him. But Mr. Satoyama's skull had been caved in... with massive cerebral hemorrhaging. Mr. Satoyama's heart stopped a second time but doctors revived it. Meanwhile, his fianc?e, Megumi Matsumoto... sat waiting for him at a restaurant... when the police called. She rushed to the hospital not sure what had happened to her fianc?. By the time she arrived... Mr. Satoyaa was dead. An officer approached and handed her... the wedding rings that had fallen from Mr. Satoyama's bag. This ""little"" incident, as you described it, received but... two lines in the newspaper. Mr. Satoyama's life... ended at the age of 32, within days of his wedding. His heart resumed beating twice! Seems he wanted to live. To fulfill a promise he'd made to someone important. She has a right to know... who took her fianc?'s life. And why he's suddenly gone. Why else would she be here today, enduring so much pain? I don't intend... to let a person fabricate stories for selfish motives... if it keeps her from the truth. This is a trial to understand the weight of a man's life. Your Honor, I ask to submit a new piece of evidence. It must be submitted in advance. I understand. But it was just discovered. And I'd like Mr. Hanaoka to see it. What's that? Defense counselor? It depends on the content. We'll see it to determine if it can be submitted as evidence. From the arson's cell phone. Great work. On that night, a fire broke out about a kiloeter away. This is a photo of it, taken at 8:50 p.m. 10 minutes before the murder. It shows the defendant. Mr. Hanaoka... can a man be in two places at the same time? It's a doctored photo! Rebut him, Gamo! Quiet in the court. Let's hear defense's opinion. Counselors approach the bench. Let me ask one thing. How'd you come by this? By searching the cell phones of 835 onlookers. 835. I'll allow it to be submitted. What? You're working for me! No, I'm Mr. Umebayashi's attorney. Testimony that the defendant was seen in Akasaka on Sept. 10th is false. Please strike it from the record. Remove the witness. What kind of trial is this? Be aware that you may be called to stand trial for perjury. I don't acknowledge this. Hanaoka's alibi is destroyed! Order in the court! At least it's quiet now. Yes, it is. Let us resume. We acknowledge the defendant's presence near the site. But it does not prove that he was the assailant. The Justice Minister has lifted the freeze on the Hanaoka investigation. Prosecutors have commenced a compulsory search... of 15 locations, including Hanaoka's office and home in Yamaguchi. You think Mr. Kuryu really wasn't after Mr. Hanaoka? He's a man who's only concern is finding the truth. As he did with me. He showed me who I really am. If he hadn't tried my case... I doubt I'd have the peace of mind I have today. I don't think I could ever be like him. Sure you can. You're already at the gate. Defendant, coe forward. You are hereby sentenced to 8 years imprisonment... including the 75 days spent in the custody of the court... for manslaughter. At 9 p.m., Sept. 10th, 2007... in the vicinity of 5-10, 2nd Street in Tokyo's Setagaya Ward... - I'm hungry. - For? - Cheongguk-jang. - Again? - I couldn't eat it 'cause of you. - I was being assaulted. You are fortunate. You have a good mentor. Oh, I don't know. Mr. Kuryu... I wanted you to know that I'll be appealing the decision. I look forward to it. See you in court, then. What do you mean ""I don't know"" - You're a pain. - No, I'm not. You kidding me? That's Kohei Kuryu. Nabeshima... you've raised a good D.A. You're paying. What is cheongguk-jang, anyway? If it was so hard to find in Korea, how'd you expect to find it here? What're you always listening to? None of your business. I don't want to know. Don't wanna know. Can't hear you. - Hanaoka was arrested. - He was? - And Umebayashi? - Eight years. - To be appealed. - Gamo's persistent. - So were you, boss. - Thanks. - No divorce. - Really? Go figure. My daughter can't live without me. She kept saying, ""Poor Papa""! ""Show some pity!"" Now we have even more cause to celebrate. Together? What could be more boring? Then why're you all here? - Speed date! - Dinner with the boss. Seeing my daughter. Dance practice, Suetsugu? Sure! Kuryu, you can see Amamiya home today. That's okay. Deputy Chief! Good work, everybody. Here's a product we can all get our heads around! I can make it. Cheongguk-jang? Yup. Yes! This is a little miracle! To little miracles. - You should try some. - No, thanks. Carlo would love to ask Carrie out. Unfortunately, Carrie doesn't speak a word of Spanish! Next time, I'll go alone. Where, Korea? After all you went through? I liked the place. And Mr. Kang's very handsome. Really? Oh, what he said to me. What does it ean? - Nothing. - Liar. - Who cares? - I do. What? Why're you grinning? Just talk into the Travelmaker... and it instantly gives you a translationl Developed by the U.S. Military... it uses an advanced voice recognition system. Wait, say that again. Now Korean compatiblel We're offering it to you for only $89.99I ""Don't let her go""? Oh, I see. How about dinner tonight? I'd love to. And the best view in town. Really?

Kamchatka (2002) - full transcript,"The film is seen through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, Harry (Matías del Pozo), who does not know that Argentina's 1976 coup d'état is impacting his life. After witnessing the ""disappearance"" of dissident friends, a human rights lawyer (Ricardo Darín) and his research scientist wife (Cecilia Roth) flee the city and hide from the military police in a vacant summer house. With them are their two kids: Harry, who is fascinated with the escape artistry of Harry Houdini, and El Enano, his little brother. (Translated as ""Little Guy"" in the English subtitles, played by Milton de la Canal. The actual translation is ""dwarf"".) The family adopts new identities and attempts to lead a normal life. Later, they are joined by a student who is using the alias Lucas (Tomás Fonzi). Their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents (Fernanda Mistral and Héctor Alterio) reveals that they are still a close-knit family. Subtly hinted, however, and used as a metaphor, is the mother's constant smoking and El Enano's renewed bed-wetting. Both serve to show how stressful and precarious their situation is.","...Kamchatka. In the beginning there was a cell, nothing else. That cell split into two, those two into others, and so on. Some cells became plants, others bugs... ... others animals... ... and others us. What they never explain is what happens next... ... between the moment the cells become a person... ... and that person climbs the Himalayas... ... discovers a vaccine... ... or becomes a famous escapist like Houdini. That is a real mystery. No textbook mentions this. No teacher does. But my dad did so. Once. The last time I saw him. My story, like all stories, begins with a cell... ... but ends in Kamchatka. Life, the supreme mystery. The energy which induces cells to join together... Fall, 1976. ... and form tissues... Days after Argentina's military coup ""o"". It's got to have a vowel!

ABRACADABRA Bertuccio's mum's making escalopes. - You're an invader! - Here. Wow! The latest edition! Yes, just out. - Where are we going? - To a friend's house. You took me out of school just for that? We'll be back soon, okay? It's Thursday, remember. I've got English, then I'm going to Bertuccio's. - Not today. - Why not? - We can't. - Why not? - Because we're going on a trip. - Aren't we going... ...to your friends'? -We'll drop in and set off from there. I don't want to go there. What am I gonna do? I'll get bored. - So leave me here and pick me up later from Bertuccio's. - No. I told you to leave me here and pick me up later! - Are you crazy or what? - Leave me here! - I won't! - Why not? - Because I say so! - Keep going, madam.

I was in the laboratory... ...when I saw her waving at me, 'Your husband on the phone! ' I asked him what happened 'I'd been trying to reach you at the... ...law office and nobody would answer! ' He told me... ...some militars had searched the office and kidnapped Roberto... ...his partner. What's wrong, sweetie? Do you want something? - Where's the bathroom? - Down the hall. - Do you want me to go with you? -No. I'd rather sleep on the floor. Little guy's kicking the hell out of me. This bed is going to hell! Are you sleeping there with mum? So, tell me. What happened today? A girl saw the invaders disintegrate a truck. Then David Vincent had to find the driver... I saw that one, about three times. Your mum? How was she? The Rock! She didn't let me go to Bertuccio's. - What happened to Roberto? - What do you mean? Don't goof around. - Did mum tell you? - They took him away, right? But nothing'll happen to him? You'll get him out. That's what lawyers are for. But Roberto's a lawyer, too. Do lawyers get taken away, too? - Nothing will happen to you, right? -No. Nothing. You know what we're gonna do? Go away for a while, till things calm down. I got a house in the suburbs. I've never been there, but I'm told it's terrific! A pool... ...we can play soccer, you name it! -Can Bertuccio come? Do you think so? I mean, if we invite him, we get him into our mess, too. You wouldn't want that. Take the third left. - Back to the city? - Do it! - We just came that way! - Me, pilot. You, driver. - My lion, I want my lion. - Once mum drove into a gas station. On the way out, she didn't know if she had to go... ...right or left. - You're not in the game, shut up! - She's as disoriented as a spinning top. - I want my lion! - So we get out of here. - Third left. - Can I look, dad? - Yes. TEG - Hey, look. - He won't like it. - Why not? - It's hard plastic. Little Guy's is a cuddly one. Get the car keys from mum. Not a word. Hurry up! There's a tree behind the house. Leave it there, no one'll see it. Come on, Little Guy. - You know what a call for action is? -What? Like in movies when the soldier warns of an Indian attack? - Yes. - And the Indians go: Ooh, ooh, ohh! If mum or I call for action, you must do this... - Drop what you're doing... - What if... ...we're drinking Nesquik? ...drop what you're doing... ...and come here running, very, very, very fast. So, what you do is this. Listen carefully. Yes. - Find this stone... - Yes. Stretch out your arms, close your eyes, lower your head... ...and wriggle through. - Got it? - Yes. - Who wants to try first? - Me! Use your arms. Watch out for your eyes. When mum or I call for action... ...find the stone and wriggle through. - That way's north. The way we came. - Yes. And that's south. It leads straight to the village. Be careful! Don't you fall! Who lived here before us? Not a clue. But somebody lent you the house. A friend of a friend I don't know. We forgot to bring coal. Help me gather some firewood. HOCUS-POCUS Harry Houdini was born in Budapest... ... on March 24, 1874. He was an escapist, not a magician, as believed. An escapist can get out of the most difficult situations. - Do you wanna play with me? - Not even drunk... ...as a skunk! - I haven't told you what at yet! Ok, tell me. You're the skunk, nerd! To do his job, Houdini had to be in perfect physical shape. He ran several miles a day... ... and could stay under water for four minutes. Four minutes! Houdini offered rewards to anyone who could lock him up. Many accepted the challenge, only to lose. He always escaped! - Yummy! - Try the chili sauce. I made the Tabasco too, but it's a bit hotter. The amount of firewood I had to use! It burns quicker than... Chemical coals burn slower... What's this? The rule is... ...science at the table... ...is bad manners! Can we get to the point? We'll be staying here for a while. We don't know... ...for how long yet. And our stuff? There's nothing here. - It's boring! - It's boring! I may go by the house soon and bring some stuff... ...or have someone do it. No school for a time. I must go to the lab. But dad'll stay with you for a few days. - Tell them about the names. - Just a second. Be careful around the pool, it's dangerous. I'll teach you to use the gas and fill the tank... ...there's no running water. Don't answer or use the phone. - It's forbidden. - Why? If your mum says so, there's a reason, ok? Right, from now on, we change our names. - Change them? - No one must know we're here. If anyone comes asking for us or phones... - They're not supposed to answer! -Wait, wait... You mean we'll have other names? - Yes. - For ever? For some time, we said. Then what if I have a new name and I phone Bertuccio? He'll realize it's me, he's not stupid. Didn't I make myself clear? No phone calls, I said. Not even if your name's ""The Wizard of Oz"". From now on, we're the Vincents. I'm David... ...and I'm an architect. David Vincent, the architect! - What? What? - Like in The Invaders. Dad is David Vincent! - Can I choose my name? - Me too? Harry. I wanna be Harry. Nobody's wearing what we used to. We could only bring... ...what we had on. Me neither. - I want MY pajamas. What's wrong with this lion that's so hard? He's softening it up. What happened? Did you drink a lot of coke last night? - Don't say anything. - Ok, but you have to promise me something. What? You won't drink anything... ...at night, nothing. No soda water, no water, coke, nothing. Is it dead? It's the one I saw before. It must have drowned. It can't drown! It's a toad! Toads breathe air. Obviously, it got trapped. Yucky creature. Loot at the skin. ""...Houdini's first stage name was Eric The Great."" Because his real name wasn't Harry, see? ""At first, he was assisted in his performance... ...by a co-worker from the factory where he worked."" Because he was poor and worked since he was a boy. ""But later, he turned to his younger brother, Theo."" Turn it up, little guy. I wanna watch The Saint! The Minister denied categorically that anyone... ... on the list is being held by the executive power, or in prison... They gotta whitewash political prisoners. - Who, me? - Let me listen to it. Tie me up, Little Guy. - Who, me? - Yes, you. We're writing a new chapter in Argentina's... ... economic history. Sure, a new chapter. We'll open our markets to foreign trade... Is that okay? Tighter. ... leading to the freedom of our productive forces... What will your productive forces produce? More misery. Perfect. - Okay? - Yes. The President of Argentina, General Jorge Rafael Videla... ... stated that the government will beat the rebels at any cost... Hey, what are you doing? - Whitewashing the prisoner! - Go away! Who am I? I said, who am I? - Vincent. - I work for...? A construction company. Campbell & Co. - What about mom? - Housewife! We met at...? - At... - University. We studied together. She quit when we married. I told you a million times! Come here. Stand here. Hold this hand firm, move this one when you hit. Watch your feet. Wide apart, this way. Look that way. Make sure the wood holds steady, about a meter away... ...so that it doesn't splinter away. Okay? -Yes. Let's see. Again... ...further back... ...here, come on! - Can I come in? - Yes. What's cooking, good-looking? - What's that? - Trunks. - Nice, eh? - Yes. Houdini used to be chained inside and thrown into the sea. Once he was at the bottom of a swimming pool... ...for 90 minutes, no oxygen tubes, nothing. - Amazing, isn't it? - Houdini, the magician? He wasn't a magician! He was an escapist. It's different. - Sure. Where did you get this? - I found it there. Only a fool would leave this. Maybe this Pedro left it for you... - What? Really! - When I grow up... ...I wanna be an escapist. And be locked in there, and thrown in the sea? Really? My little boy. You know something? A boy's coming to live with us. A boy? Who? - Just a boy. - Are you gonna adopt him? Don't be a fool! It's just for a few days. He needs someplace to stay. But you gotta help me with the Little Guy. Ok? You know, changes upset him... Poor thing. I know he's doing his best, isn't he? - Did he give you much trouble today? -No. So, what then? Will you help me? Will you? You know what's important. - What? -Knowing how long it takes to unchain yourself. When you know so, you'll know how much... ...oxygen you need. Because oxygen needs space. If you don't give it space, you'll suffocate. So this way they'll survive? Some will. The smart ones, for sure! Back a bit, there. There, hold it. Don't let it go. There we go. Hold it. Now let it go. Ready. - Why don't we use this? It's easier. - But at night... ...when we're asleep, or when we leave this place... They gotta learn to survive alone! Here comes mom! Here comes mom! Stay with me. She's with the boy. Hi, mom! Hi, sweetie. Oh, I missed you so much. - Have you played a lot today? - Yes! - This way, Lucas. - Okay. Where's your brother? - Where's he? -I don't know, somewhere around. - Did you have your milk? Did daddy make it for you? -Yes! - He did? - Yes! Hello, love. Fine. - This is David, my husband. - How's it going? - Okay? - Fine. - Gorgeous place, you were right. - Simon, our youngest son. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. And this is Harry. Harry. Cool name. He speaks, but I hypnotize him when we have guests. This is Lucas, boys. He's gonna stay with us for a few days. - Can we show Lucas around? - Of course. We gotta take it all down. Come on! SAINT'S BED HARRY AND SIMON'S CLOSET HARRY'S BED Why take them down? Because he's not a boy. He's a guard, a cop! What if he's an Invader? Excuse me. And the mattress? We took it outside to somersault. - Lucas's gonna sleep here with you. - I can sleep... ...in the living room. - No! It's freezing to death there. Put your things anywhere. - Who's the cutest little boy in the world? -Me! I'd take you in my purse... ...if I could fit you in! How much I love you! Me toooo! If you behave well, very, very well... ...we're gonna go home and get... ...some stuff. - My lion! ...please, mom! - My TEG! -My pajamas, my tiki-taka! -Stop it! Only one thing each, or it's gonna be too much. - Don't be mean, mom. - Alright, 2 things, 3 things. - TEG, TEG! Please, bring the TEG -Tiki-taka! If you need anything, ask Lucas, ok? Lucas!!! Come here. - How long has he been wetting the bed? -Two days. But don't tell him I told you. Don't worry, I'll take care of him. - I'm gonna call as many times as I can. - But we can't answer! 3 rings and I hang up, twice. On the third call you can answer. - That's our secret code. - Bye! You pour the milk in this way. See? And stir, and stir. It's lumpy. You can chew the lumps like this. - Chocolate! - You can't have Nesquik. You'll get tummy ache. Oh, really? Ask me to help you out, then. I can make some for you. Your name's not Lucas, is it? No, it isn't. Are you really Harry? Newfoundland to N.Y., 3. Brazil to Sahara, 3. Again, Brazil to Sahara, 3. - I take my own counters! - Don't get pissed off. Hurry. Iran to China with 3. - Again? - I'm winning. Again, because I'm winning. Iran to China with 3. Again, with 3. You... just 1. That's ""TEG"". The world is divided into countries. These are controlled by armies. Each army is a different color. For example, right now I'm the blue army. The first one to control 30 countries wins. But that's with 4 or 5 players. With dad, I play one to one. To live or die. And I always die. Taimir to Siberia with 3. - Let him win sometime. - Why? He'll win when he can! Not again! - Morning. - Hi. There's coffee in the fridge. Mom makes gallons of coffee and then reheats it. - Thanks, I had some earlier when your folks left. - Are they gone? - Where? - I don't know. - What time are they coming back? -They didn't say. You know nothing! Is this yours? I know some magic, if you have some cards I'll teach you tricks. Card games are for kids. And magic is stupid! Houdini was an escapist, not a magician. What he did, he did for real. HOW LONG? HE RAN SEVERAL MILES A DAY HOUDINI HAD TO BE IN PERFECT PHYSICAL SHAPE HE COULD STAY UNDER WATER FOR FOUR MINUTES FOUR MINUTES! Let us pray. Lord, let's pray so that this sacrament, received with joy... ...in commemoration of St. Jerome... ...encourages the hearts of the faithful. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now and forever. Our help cometh from the Lord. Who created heaven and earth. Let us stand. In the name of the Father... ...and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Don't worry, they won't be in the records. There'll be a report card, but no legal record or anything... ...that could reach the Ministry. Hey, don't be mad. We don't want you to get behind, that's all. You've missed enough. But if you catch up, and when all this is over... ...you'll be back in the same class at your old school. Anyway, it's good to meet new people, make new friends... I don't need new friends. I already have friends, but you don't let me see them! - Good morning. - Good morning, father John. Very kind of you. I guess these clothes are a donation. But, if you decide to claim for them... ...you can do it personally at my office. I'm here to introduce a new classmate. This is not a Roman circus... ...so please don't behave like lions. This is Harold. Welcome. - Daddy, what's this? - It's like a greeting. Evening. How's it going? - Have you eaten? - No, nothing. Join us. How was your first day? I think I put my foot in it. Hello, God! Bye, God! - The teacher said I had nice hair. - Of course you do. You wanna dance? Hey! Hey, where are you going? It's cold out. Mom, come and join us. Your breathing... ...must always be regular... ...always. Regular. Keep the pace! Come on! - What's this? - Are you okay? I don't know. Yes. Fine. The key is to resist. The fastest never wins. The one that holds on does! - Where did you learn to run this way? -The less you know... ...about me, the safer it'll be for you. - At least... ...tell me if you always ran like this or if you learned. All good things are learned. We know some things since we're born. - But you gotta learn to do them well. - Really? Thinking. That's one. - Swimming. - Breathing. Moving, walking, running...! Feeling. - Speaking. - Laughing. - Looking. - Touching. Playing. Singing. - Come join us! - You're nuts! Move it! - State-owned or private? - Sate-owned. - Which area? - Wrong question. - City or suburbs? - Neither. - Where are you from? - Wrong question. - Come on, tell me. - Okay, La Plata, but... - You got a dad? - Yes, I have. - You got a mom? - Yes, I have. - Then, what are you doing here? -Wrong question. - You had an argument with your parents and ran away? -No! Then, what are you doing here? - I'm fighting to save the world. - Come on! See? You don't believe the truth. Your parents threw you out after a fight? No! One leaves home after a fight or to get married. - That's old-fashioned! -That's you! You think you're cool... ...'cause you have a girlfriend. - Who told you? I saw her! I saw her! - Where? -There's a photo in your wallet and I saw her tits! Oh, shit! Freedom, freedom...! - He's drunk, isn't he? - Completely. - What happened? - What happened, love? - He's pissed! -We will make Will Cadory to spit. - W?ll what? -We will make Will Cadory to spit. Who's Will Cadory? We will swear with Glory to live! - Why are you back so early? - You scared me. You should be at work. I was fired... ...from the lab. - Do you want your milk? - Yes. Let me prepare it. When I grow up, I wanna be a saint. I told you before, Simon Templar isn't a real saint. What's this? Who are you? Get out! Let me go! Let me go! What will you do with us? Don't waste your time. Perhaps he won't return. The ship needs him. Hello? Hello? Hello? - Who is it? - Some idiot. How come you don't know the name of any classmate? - They're all stupid. - No way! - Is that too tight? - Tighter. - Tighter? - Tighter. - I'm making it tight. - Perfect. Perfect. - I'll time you. - Stay on that side! - On the other side? - But don't look, okay? Let's see... If it's a minute, you're ""Houdini"". If it's 2, you're ""Averagini"". More than 3, you're ""Louserini"". - Come on! - Ready? - Yes. - Go, go! Hey, if you shit on your pants, you're out. Don't you have any friends? Of course I do. When do you see them? Never. Don't you ever feel like calling them? What if you call them? Would they tell you off? No. Why? I'm a fugitive and I don't wanna put them in danger. And the way things are... You're my only friend, now. You're all I've got. Well, you and your family. Come on! You're 30 seconds away from losing. Did you hear me? Sit up. It was too tight, you could say so! Or do I have to teach you to speak as well? Give me your hand. That's it. - Does it hurt? - I can't feel anything. Give me the other hand. If it's too tight it cuts off your bloodstream. - Better? -What if they don't come back? Mom and Dad, what if they don't come back? - We got held up. - Are the kids asleep? - Did they eat okay? - We had to avoid... ...the military check-out points. - Harry was a bit sick. I'm here, sweetie. Call me if you need me. I know you're awake, you know, 'cause I gave you birth. Of all my scientific experiments, which I did a lot... ...you're the one that came out best. I don't care if I'm talking nonsense... ...or drooling your ear... ...or if I sound like Bertuccio's mom. My sweet, my darling little boy... Keep all the kisses. I love you. Dad didn't agree, as usual. But I convinced him. So we leave... ...first thing Saturday and return Sunday night. Yes! We're going to grandpa's birthday. Yippee! We're going! - Can Lucas come? -I invited him but he's got stuff to do. - The oil's burning! -Get out of my way, I'm in a hurry. - Let me help. - Okay, come here. You gotta add some stock to the egg to make it tastier. - Where did you pick that up? - Bertuccio's mom told me. - She's a genius. - What a concept of genius you've got! So it's the same: Einstein, Michelangelo and Bertuccio's... ...mother who is a fat ass! - She's not fat. - Move... She's always at home and she helps with his homework! Yes, but you never need help. It's burning. You finish frying them, okay? Be careful with the oil. Any problems, ring Bertuccio's mom. - Are you serious? - No, just kidding. I was kidding! - You gotta go? - Yes. - Where? - A meeting at work. - You were fired! - They fired me from the lab. But I still have stuff to do. - More important than us? - No, never. So stay here, then. You can't ask me to do something wrong. Not you. You know, your dad's old now. He won't be with you much longer. If he gets on your nerves, take a deep breath... ...and count to ten. Do you do that every night? I wish she did. But we hear you every night going ""Ah, ah, ah..."" Look at him. He's been asleep the whole journey. No, remember, he woke up in La Plata asking about vaccines. ""Daddy, daddy, do you have to be vaccinated to be a saint?"" Look what he did! - I almost strangled him! - Don't give him hell, he hasn't... ...wetted the bed today. Well, I got up 3 times to take him to pee but it was worth it. - I got up once. - And me twice more! - I can't believe it. - That's why he looks like a zombie. - Zombie! Happy birthday, grandpa! Thank you. I see you still have that old heap! With two boys, it's the best car to have. Happy birthday. Open it! Open it! Oh, my favorites! - Mom, are they chocolate? - No, they're real. - Happy birthday, grandpa. - More gifts! Let's see. I don't know if you want to please me or kill me? Whisky and cigars! You know when I last saw you? - When? - 6 months and 12 days ago. It's not your fault. ...8, 9, 10. And now? Do I start again? Take a deep breath. First, second, third, fourth... ...and reverse. Again, but harder. - That's it, good. - First... ...second, third... ...fourth... - Tell me, your friend from China? - Japan! - China, Japan... How is he doing? - He changed school last year. - Really? What about... what's his name, Bertutti? - Bertuccio! - Bertuccio. How's Bertuccio doing? Don't tell me he also changed school! - No, I did. - Really? To a religious school run by a priest friend of dad's. Since we've been going, my brother wants to be a saint. We live in the suburbs. Mom was fired from the lab. Dad had to shut down... ...his law office. Some militars broke into it... ...and destroyed everything, they seized Roberto, his partner. Sometimes he works at home. Before, he used to work in pubs but there were... ...a lot of policemen around. Promise me something. Grandpa. Grandpa. - Yes. - Don't fight. Not this time. If I'm not wrong, there should be one here. - What's that smell? - Mothballs. That's how things last for so long. Here we go. This one. Let's see... I knew it would fit. This is all like it always was, right? I mean, when dad was a kid. Just the same. Why didn't you change it? - Into a playroom! - For me? In a way, it is a playroom, the way it is. It's my time machine. Whenever I come to dust, I sit here and look around... ...and remember things. You miss him, don't you? You want to know if I go around weeping like a fool? No, I don't. But I like to remember the good old times. We gotta find a reed... ...as thick as a finger, more or less. Hollow it, then you can use it to breathe under water. - This one? -No, as thick as my finger not yours. If not, you can't breathe! - But there aren't any that thick. - There are a lot, look. All right. Schools always need teachers. That could be a temporary solution, at least. Try and convince him. If I do... ...he won't listen. If his dad does, hell's gonna burn. You know how they are, two of a kind. Come in, love. We're also to blame. Why? 'Cause we taught him to take love, but not to give it. They love each other whether fighting or playing tough. You know what it's like to live with 3 brutes. But then, when they grow up and can't fight any more... Nothing will change. Someway, they'll fight differently. You won't be like that, will you, dear? The situation's tough, dad, militars kill people every day. We want to be together as much as we can. Is it so hard to understand? - Come on, pour. - It'll hurt. - You must see a doctor! - Pour. David Vincent is brave and doesn't cry. - Are you okay? - Yes. Poor bird, eh? - Can I take one? - Yes. Here. Then it's bath time, ok? All right. See you up there. No, wait. Hang it round your neck. Like that. - Press here, right? - Yes. This one to shoot... ...and turn here to wind the film. - What are you doing? - I'm taking a photo. No, don't, really. I hate photos. You can take one of all this, or that duck... - Who cares about the duck? - Go on, take one, but not of me. I always come out with a stupid grin on my face... ...and you wonder, ""What was this guy thinking about?"" What are you thinking about now? That my son's a pain in the ass taking photos... ...when I don't want. - Come on, dad, tell me. That we should've come here more often. And... why don't we stay? Because we can't. Look at me. Hey, look at me. Look at me now. Look at me now. We can't, son. We can't. We can't. Do you understand? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Grandpa... ... happy birthday to you. Blow! Bravo! What a lot of smoke! Move together for a photo. Cheer up a bit, please. - Grandpa's teaching me to drive. - I wanna learn, too. - Tell grandpa he's nuts. - He told me you'd say that. He also told me to tell you that you learned to drive... ...when you were younger than me. That's better. Sleep, little baby... ... your mommy's in the field. Leave him, you big boy. You'll wake him. May I? - Look, a shooting star! - Where? There. Didn't you see it? It's gone now. It fell. When your mom and dad were engaged... ...we'd sit here after dinner, looking at the sky. There were lots of Russian and US satellites and capsules then. On a moonless night, you could see them. We did once. Mom and her satellite! It was a shooting star! - It was a red light! - No! Red was the wine you had. What's a shooting star? If you stare at the sky without blinking... ...you might see a star... ...come and go... ...at 1000 mph. - Goodnight all. - See you tomorrow. - Come here, grandpa. - No, you're going to make me fall. Careful, be careful. Who's gonna get me up now? - He will, he's the strongest in the family. - Stay there, grandpa. If I get cold, not even a crane will get me out of here! They're called shooting stars... ...but they are really meteorites or bits of rock... - No, no science, please! - Sure? - Yeah. - I can't see anything. You have to be patient. If you see one, you can make a wish. - What have wishes to do with stars? -Honestly I don't know... ...but they always come true. I made one once, right here. - And it came true. - Really? Whatever, but I'm sure it was a satellite. For God's sake, mom! - Look, another one! - Where? There, look. You're a liar, mom! Shooting stars are stones... ... that burn up when they get close to the atmosphere. Mom was right about that. For some reason... ... they are directly related to wishes. Dad was right about this. I watched and watched till my eyes burnt... ... but I didn't see anything. That must be why my wish didn't come true. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! You're gonna knock me down. What happened to the lights? A local blackout. What's up? You got a minute? Give your mom a hand before it rains. Come on! Dead toad! Dead toad! This isn't a hole. It's an elevator. We'll put it there so it can go straight... ...to toads' heaven. I'm gonna wash my hands. I gotta go. Now? You'll get soaking wet! - Your dad's taking me to the station. - Can I go? - No. - Why not? It's just a second. It's late. I waited just to say goodbye. I'm going, Harry, this time for good. - Do you really have to go? - Yes. Why? Wrong question. Is that it, then? ""Bye"", I turn and leave? - Aren't we friends? - Friends? What for? We'll never see each other again. - I left my orange T-shirt. - Go get it yourself. Lucas! Lucas! If they ask, say I'm ill. - Mom's gonna be mad. - Say you don't know. Say we went in together and you didn't see me again. Okay? Go on, I'll meet you here. Oh, I forgot. Your comic. Three requirements... ... distinguish the professional escapist from the amateur. First, discipline. The escapist knows his task is a daily one... ... arduous and restless. A ticket to Buenos Aires. Second, concentration. The escapist must distinguish... ... the important from the superfluous. The last requirement is courage. The escapist needs it... ... to see his task through to the end. Good morning. - Is Bertuccio in? -No, he's not back. He's at his aunt's. That's a pity. - Tell him I called by. - Of course, dear. Can I come by another day? Yes, but phone first. The Houdini book tells a lot of things. Where he was born, who his parents where... ... how he became famous... ... what his most difficult stunts were. The only thing it doesn't tell... ... is how he managed to escape. He's coming! Mom, Dad, he's coming! Mom, Dad, he's here! Mom, Dad, he's here! My little boy, my little boy. That night we had a historic match. Spain to Great Britain with 3. With 2. I immediately began to beat my dad. I was beating him by far. Brazil to Sahara with 3. You move your counters, I'll move mine, okay? At the crucial point... ... I controlled forty- nine countries. Forty- nine! And he had only one. Siberia to Kamchatka with 3. China to Kamchatka with 3. Japan to Kamchatka with 3. Wait! I'm regrouping! - May I explain? - Shut up and play! Add three. Pass. China to Kamchatka with 3. This went on for hours. Kamchatka versus the rest of the world. But I couldn't beat him. Kamchatka to Siberia, 3. The following morning, Dad called for action. Hurry up! Take him! Mom? What's wrong with dad? They also got Oscar. What do we do now? Can I go to the toilet? Wait till dad finishes. I can go with him, he's finished. - There you go. - Go out. - Are you there? - Yes. Did you see all the people out there eating?

Fear and Desire (1952) - full transcript,Four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines must confront their fears and desires.,"FEAR AND DESIRE There is war in this forest. Not a war that's been fought, or one that will be, but any war. And the enemies who struggle here do not exist, unless we call them into being. This forest, then, and all that happens now, is outside History. Only the unchanging shapes of fear and doubt and death are from our world. These soldiers that you see keep our language and our time, but have no other country than the mind. Do you think they're looking for us? It's one of ours alright. He can't see us. But maybe they saw a plane back there. There isn't much left of it to see, 'less it's still burning. Even if they could spot us, there isn't anything they could do to help us here. Yeah. Six miles behind the enemy lines. - Well, that's not too far. - Not too far? In those six miles there's probably thousand of guys and every one of them was taught to shoot at uniforms like this. If you're so worried about that, why don't you keep your voice down? I'm not worried. What's going to happen, Lieutenant? Somebody around who saw our plane go down. They might be looking for us in the woods already! It'd be a lot easier if ours knew where to start. It isn't very much. Too bad you fellows didn't get your rifles out of the plane. Let's see what can be done. Once you understand how a mousetrap works, if you're clever enough, you can use it as a springboard. Here are the front lines. From our position just before we crashed, we should be in this general area. Our own lines are here and we should be about here. There's a river that runs East of where we are now, I think. That river cuts through the front lines and winds up on our side. Now, as I see it, we could use our reconditioned mouse trap on the river. Is that your idea? To go down the river? Yes. But how? How can we get down it? I can't swimm very well. And Fletcher. We could do it on a raft. At night. Well, we'll never make it any other way. It's suicide to try to walk out. I wouldn't have the vaguest idea of how and where to start. This way we'd cruise through together in a few hours and arrive in one piece. - Well, by my computations... - Your computations... With your brilliant figuring that got us here in the first place. They must be somebody's pet. It has a collar. Ney, make a better watch dog. Seems friendly enough. We can't use a mascot in this trip. Hurry up! We don't have all day. If no one has a better suggestion, let's head for the river. Some more animals might show up. It's hard. One foot fights the other. - Get there, before it burns in the bushes! - I could do it alone. - Nobody's safe here. - Are they watching me? - Getting hungry. - What's up? - They're all scared. - How hungry... - Who'll they look out to later? - Oh, the cracking in my head. - I bet he was wounded. - I don't run for no reason. What's gonna hang from the trees tonight? - Hurry! - We'll die in the woods! - Don't die here! - They're scared. Alright, alright. Lead them on! After we get past this road, the river isn't much further. Mac! Get down on the road and take a look. You know? There's nothing so refreshing as an afternoon out of doors in enemy territory. It's really too bad that the sun doesn't burn us green instead of brown. Camouflage! Well, if you see some strange faces across the way, wave to them casually and try to look as native as possible. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Come here. Bring your binoculars. - What do you want? - I'd like you to see something. Around the river bend. - What? - I can't make out exactly what it is, but I think you'll be interested. Come on! Over there. See? Looks like some kind of small air strip. Yes, you're right. Lots of rank around. It looks like a General! Sure. A General! He is a General! Let's get back and help with the raft. Mac, let's go! All we need now is Huckleberry Finn. - This oughtta see us through. - Yeah, it doesn't look bad at all. Should we make sure it floats? Rafts always float. It's unfortunate that we don't have a fine bottle to christen it with. We could give it a name... He must have seen us! If we stay here, we'll get killed! It's starting to get dark. Perhaps they didn't see us. But it's too dangerous to wait here until we find out. What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get back? Hurry up, let's go! That plane must have landed down that house we saw before. What's the difference? There must be something big going on down there. Maybe the General is having a convention tonight. We didn't see this on the way to the river. We've been running in a new direction. Whatever they're jumping, sure smells good. Like mother's own. Those guns look even more jummy than the food does. I've got an idea... No matter what we do from here on, we're much better off with some guns. - You better hurry. Others maybe around. - I'm gonna have some stew first. Sidney, better grab something to eat. It may be a long tima 'till our... next feast. We better eat something. How's the stew, Mac? Kinda cold, but cold stews are alright. Cold stew on a blazing island. We've just made a perfect definition of war, Mac. That's cocky! A blazing island with a tempest of gunfire around it. Perhaps if we could... - Somebody must have heard us. - Grab those guns and let's get going. - Why did you have to shoot? - Forget it. Let's move! We spend our lives running our fingers down the lists and directories, looking for our real names, our permanent adresses. No man is an island? Perhaps that was true a long time ago, before the Ice Age. The glaciars have melted away and now we're all islands, parts of a world made of islands only. How long are you gonna hang around here? We're in a fine mess now! I'd give anything to trade places with that dog we chased yesterday. Seems like whenever people get in a hole they get to get jealous of dogs. I admit that our prospects aren't very cheerful. But how about going back to see if our raft is still there? Look, if we were spotted, they'll have a trap waiting for us when we show up. It's a chance. Trying to walk out is as risky today as it was yesterday. We'll scout around the river and make certain. Then, what? Even if we find the raft there. Even if none of them is waiting for us. Then, what? We have to sit tight until it gets dark, and hope that we don't have a full moon. We can sing old songs if we get restless waiting. What's the matter, snowcoombs? I heard that they're cannibals. - So even if we get caught you're pretty safe. - Leave me alone! We may be in the woods, McClellan, but let's try to remain civilized. Yeah, I suppose you're right, Lieutenant. Anyway, there won't be many days left to be civilized in. If we stick around these woods much longer. - She'll see us! - Shut up! Don't be afraid, we're not going to hurt you. She's quite nice. Don't you think so, boys? What are we supposed to do with her now? I've got a wife at home. I'm afraid she's become our unvited guest. I must say I've had worse guests at better parties. All right, Corby, all right. Let's not forget where we are. ""Even if we're lost in the woods let's try to remain civilized."" Well, we can't stay here. - Shall we leave her fish here? - There'll be plenty. What are you gonna do with her, Lieutenant? Give me your belt. You too, Fletcher. Please, don't beat her! She's scared like we are. She doesn't even talk. Get a grip on yourself, no one's gonna punish her. I simply wanna tie her up. Now give me your belt. Let's hurry it up. My arm's getting tired. Be careful not to hurt her. I hope she doesn't start screaming. She's a pretty little thing. Why don't we just leave her here and get going? Don't rush me. If we can make her understand us, perhaps she can tell us whether they found the raft. You speak Spanish? I'll handle this, Sidney. I'm quite sure she wasn't educated abroad. You - see - boat? Our - boat? - Boat? - Yes, that's it, boat. You - see - boat? Don't tell me she doesn't understand you. If she can't tell us anything, let's let her go. Sure, so she can run down stream to that command post and tip our hand. You kids and your ideas! - Maybe she was going there in the first place. - With the fish, you mean? Sure. A general gets what he wants for dinner, no matter what. If it's fish cod or fresh strawberrys or gold plates... This is hardly the time to become a revolutionary. We oughtta continue to see about the raft, but we can't let her go yet. Why? What she'd do to us? If she could understand she would have told you. Mac already told you why. Sidney, you'll stay here with the young lady until we come back. Here, take this. You're gonna leave me here? Yes, I told you, to watch the girl. You're gonna make me stay and then not come back. I know because of yesterday. Keep calm, kid! If we're not back by night just get in touch with her old man about a wedding. Maybe you can settle down in a treehouse and raise some monkeys. - Leave him alone, Mac. - Remember you promised to come back, Fletcher. I want you to stay here and keep an eye on her, because she may prove very useful if the raft has been discovered. We'll be back in a couple of hours. Just relax. Don't get panicky. See you later, Sidney. I'm really glad they let me stay. I'm not fooling! Please, don't be afraid to like me. That's why they let me stay. They thought you'd like me. The troops are gone and I can't go home! Don't do that! Don't move away, it's not my fault! I stopped them from beating you. Don't scowl. Watch, I'll make you laugh. Look, I'm the General. Hey, watch me! Attention, the General is here! Attention! Glad to have you with us, Sir. Quite frankly, the situation is desperate. I don't think I can cope with it alone. Isn't funny? Isn't it? Orderly, more fat fish that the girl caught for me. The General, I'm the General. You don't even smile. What do you want? Listen. I'm lost... Lost... on this terrible island. If you have to hate me, please, try to like me also. They must have been reading a magazine in that plane. I wouldn't have believed. Mac, better take a look around the river bend. Be careful. We'll get to work camouflaging the raft. I'm a little worried about Sidney back there with the girl. I don't like the way he's been acting. You're not going softheaded and thinking about taking her along with us tonight? You're beginning to sound like Sidney. No. If she can bring three friends, perhaps. But as it is, she'll remain lodged in the forest, like we were. That must be the one that almost nailed us. There he is again. It's him! A cocky little king. And me holding binoculars like a lady watching an opera. Binoculars! Soon he'll go into his palace with all his iron lap dogs. If only this was a rifle sight and I could make the red eye between his ears. Then he'd see McClellan! Girls always love stories, but it's so hard to finish and wait for words... You wanna hear more? Do you? Alright. Then the spirit in magician's power goes back to the island and tells Miranda that her father's dead. The spirit sings how he's dead at the bottom of the ocean. His bones are coral, his eyes are pearls, and Miranda, her father's dead. Dead! Can't you understand anything? Dead! Dead! Dead! Now d'you understand? All clear? Everything's alright. - I'd like to talk to you about the house. - What house? That house down there. The one where we saw that General yesterday. Wait around, Mac. Right now I'd like you to go back to Sidney. I didn't like the way he was acting when we left. I'm a little concerned. - But don't you think... - Do as I say, will you? As soon as we're through here we'll join you. I don't want anything to go wrong back there. Here, I brought you some water. Now you like me, don't you? I'll get you loose. Just a minute. You'll put your arms around me. I know. Wait. I knew you'd like me. Just a minute. Don't run away! Don't make me stay! You're going to tell the General! You're gonna tell him I made fun of him! Come back, don't tell the General! I won't let you! Blood... Blood... No word. It's just broken with blood. What's the matter? Where's the girl? Answer me! What have you done? Tell me or I'll pulp you to a jelly! She was tired. She went to lie down. Over there. Don't annoy her, Mac. Come here. It wasn't my fault! The magician did it. Honest! Prospero the Magician! First we're a bird, and then we're an island. Before I was a general, and now I'm a fish! Hoorah for the magicians! The river... It's blood, Mac! Cold... Cold... I'm going for a swim. Come on in, Mac! Listen to them... It's blood! What happened? Where's Sidney and the girl? The kid must have gone out of his head. When I got back, he was just laying there. The girls is dead. - Over there. He shot her. - Where is he? He's gone. He yelled something about how the magician does it. Before he was something and now he's a fish. Before I could stop him he ran away towards the river. - He kept laughing and screaming. - We can't do anything abut it now. Let's move again. I'm expecting the raft to be the best way to wait 'til night. I guess there's gonna be more elbow room than I thought. Yeah. And I wanna talk to you about that house down the river and the General. - Kill him. - Yeah. No, I won't hear anymore about it. I don't know what's gotten into you, Mac. So you saw a General. So what? Raft is all set. In a couple of hours we'll be on it. Raft! Raft, raft, raft! Can't you see any further? A General... Why, he...? How many times do I have to go over this? Must I tell you again? What's one of their Generals to me? He's cheap in my rate of exchange, but our lives aren't. Your rate of exchange... You make me laugh! - If you had any guts... - Look, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. Forget about the General for a minute. What about the plane you saw? That's right! What about that plane? We've already been over this. It looks like a two seater with that small field built in the clear. One of us can take the raft down stream to the field when it gets dark and start shooting to draw the sentries from the house. The other two can plug that guy and get away in the plane, while I keep 'em busy from the raft. - You? - Sure, me. They'd get you. You'd never make it back alive. Who else could do it the way I could? You couldn't. You'd be riding home sitting down nice and comfortable up in a cockpit looking down on what's going on. Sure. You'll recite a few tags you picked up and everything will be alright. I'll just as soon make the trip back myself, on a raft. Do you think you have any chance at all to get away with it alive? I don't know. Here I am. I'm 34 years old. I've never done anything important. Nothing! When this is over I'll fix radios and washing machines. - They'll see. - Good boy, Mac. That's all. I don't care if they got a million Generals. There's one two miles from here. If his heist is gonna keep me from going nuts like Sidney. Only in a different way, I'm gonna pull up my own heist. But why should we? The raft's still there. As soon as it gets dark, it can take us all back tonight. If I draw 'em down to the river, you and Fletcher can do the job and get away in a plane. What do you say, Fletch? Well, not that I wanna seem important. Half the trouble in the world happens because of what some people do, but I think half the good things happen that way too. If we're gonna get away with it it would sure be better. I don't know the words to say what I mean, but... This is something for me. Sure, I guess we could all probably make it back on that thing, but... When you walk and walk through the woods and then suddenly they dangle a General in front of you like magic, and you know it's only for this once, you can't turn your back on 'em. None of us asked to be here, but we all have to gamble. It's not as if we could refuse. We had to gamble once we crashed, a General raised the stakes and we've been so lucky. Why shouldn't we put up a little more than we have to? What are you living for anyway? To make talk? Why? Why is your life so precious? Why? The only reason is to hunt for the reason. But, can I stand in the way of a man with a reason to die? - You'll do it. Won't you, Corby? - Do it for me. Well, we have nothing to lose but our futures. OK, I guess we leave you now. Remember, don't start for a half an hour. If the plane isn't still there, we'll have time to get back to you. Don't worry, it'll be there. Good luck, Mac. See you soon. Try not to get your feet wet. - You look out for your head. - OK, fellow. So long. - Mac, I hope that sometime... - You talk too much. I guess we both do a little. Sometimes, talk is an indispensable medicine. Yeah, but you get sicker later. Good luck. I didn't really mean what I said before about guts. Yes, you did, but only to bother you. - Take it easy, fellow. - Yeah. The plane's still there so I guess there is no really good excuse to go back. I guess not. - Can you see? - Hold it, hold it! Yes, there he is. What time is it? We have about 10 minutes before Mac begins. Let's hurry! It's better... It's better to roll up your life into one night and one man and one gun. It hurts too much to keep hurting everyone else in every direction and to be hurt with all the separate hates exploding day after day. You can't help it. A curse buzzes out of your mouth with every word you say and nobody alive can tell which is which or what you mean. Yeah. You try door after door when you hear voices you like behind them, but the nobs come off in your hand... Go in! Where did you find him? One of the men did down by the river. He was very busy baying at the moon. Dear Proteus, aren't you ashamed of yourself? Staying away without leave for two whole days. - Have a drink, Captain. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You must never, never do that again, Proteus. Don't you know that there are evil spirits without bodies... roam the forest looking for unsuspecting dogs like you? And that when you open your jaws to disturb the moon they leap into your mouth and possess you? Then you could become a spy, a murderer, or even a traitor. Not your dog, sir. He knows his allegiance. Have you been alert, Proteus? Have you detected all the distant marchings? Has your wet nose become aware of all the blood on the grass? What else can you tell us beside your puppy dog sadness? Wish he could tell us where those enemy soldiers from that wrecked plane are. They've been bothersome for the last two days. They'll soon grow tired of starving and being hunted. Even Proteus grows tired of it after two days. See that Lieutenant Proteus gets something to eat. Yes, sir. Nobody's gonna cry for me later or cheer for me now. Nobody else is me. I know that. Who else but me is buried under the chain of everything I ever did? I didn't mean any of it. It was all wrong. Good riddance! Oh, what a trade, him for me! What a thing to come to at the end, like building a bridge or stealing the crown jewels. Thanks, General! Thanks! I'll take the tombstone if it's really mine. Waiting... Waiting to kill... Waiting to heal... Waiting to die... Awaiting in the North with four divisions. One by one the men turned black through waiting for the last snowflake to dissolve. Across the valley, our enemies blew on their cold hands until no more breath came. Then they were dead. And they knew it. We were so well prepared for death that the armistice was a mutual disappointment. Now he's in his cotton house, taking up the cartridges on his maps, full of his supper. They'll get him soon. A duck at a shooting gallery, and I'll be the wheeler rolling the ducks in all the bull's eyes. I should talk. A clay pigeon on a slow raft. Frankly, I still become uneasy when I find myself trapped directing the courses of frightened men. I cannot quite admit that it is I who am creating a slaughter in this abyss, or that I left the road, that I ordered this and that. I'm trapped. What is a prison for me? I make a grave for others. To your health, sir. It's the only way to finish up. Alone, like the North Pole in the middle of the night. The river is helping me out of my life. Sometimes, these maps... Sometimes, as I look at these maps, I wonder if my own grave isn't being planned. Here... Or here... Or here. No more Sundays. No more a thousand things. I'm a little scared though. Just a little... like kissing my great grandma when she was dying. Come on out here, bunch of half-witted cannibals! I missed him, I think he's only wounded! We have to finish him off. But they stopped shooting at the river. They'll be here any minute. I surrender! Come on, let's go! Please, please, we don't have any time. You going back? Can I come? I won't be any bother. Sure, kid. Hop on, there plenty of room. You look tired. Yeah. Thanks a lot for stopping. There was so much noise in there... All right, Mac. You rest. I'll be quiet. You know? I lost my watch! Mac, don't close your eyes! The trees! They're naked! They're naked, Mac! And what happened to the Sergeant? I don't know, sir. He might make it. Sir, with your permission, I'd like to go down to the river and watch for him for a while. Yes, sir, the same goes for me. You most certainly have the right to it if you wish. Do you think he'll come back? I don't know. I'm not sure yet whether even we've come back. I think we've all travelled too far from our own private boundaries to be certain about these other things anymore... Or come back to ourselves. Part of me is glad, but... Yeah. I'm glad in a way too. And I feel free all of a sudden. But somehow I don't want what I wanted before. I know it's good. There's nothing else I can want. I'm all mixed up... I wish I could want what I wanted before. Is your head bugging you? No, it's something else... What's that? I guess I'm not... built for this. Nobody ever was. It's all a trick we perform when we'd rather not die... immediately. Come on!",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Fear_and_Desire-45758

You've taken a vow of silence? Yeah. He's gonna join the Air Force Academy, become a test pilot... and he's taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. - You're kidding? - Hi, Uncle Frank. Oh, hey, Olive. Wow, you're gettin' big. Almost like a real person. - [Chuckles] - [Olive Gasps] - What happened to your arms? - Olive. That's all right. I had a little accident. I'm okay. - How's the, uh, routine coming, honey? - It's good. Yeah? When are you gonna show it to us? I don't know. It's up to Grandpa. A couple of days. It still needs work. What's that? Chicken? Every night it's the fuckin' chicken! - Holy God Almighty! It is possible just once- - Dad! We could get something to eat around here that's not the goddamn fucking chicken? - Hey, Dad! Dad! - I'm just sayin'- - Christ. - When you want to start cooking your own food, you're welcome. - At Sunset Manor, you know- - If you like Sunset Manor, you shouldn't have got kicked out. For God's sakes. So when did you start with the vow? Been nine months, Frank. He hasn't said a word. Not one. I think it shows tremendous discipline. - Richard. - I really do. Really. I think we could learn something from Dwayne. Dwayne has a goal. He has a dream. It may not be my dream, may not be yours... but he's pursuing it with great conviction and focus. In fact, I was thinking about the nine steps- Oh, for crying out loud! And how Dwayne's utilizing seven of them in his personal quest to self-fulfillment. Richard, please. Well, I'm just saying I've come around. I think he could use our support. How did it happen? - How did what happen? - Your accident. Honey, here. [Frank] Oh, no, it's okay. Unless you object. No, I'm pro-honesty here. I just think, you know, it's up to you. Be my guest. Olive, um, Uncle Frank didn't really have an accident. What happened was he... tried to kill himself. You did? Why? [Stammering] I'm sorry. I don't think this is an appropriate conversation. Honey, let's let Uncle Frank finish his dinner, okay? Shh. Why did you want to kill yourself? [Richard] No, don't answer the question, Frank. - Richard! Richard! - He's not gonna answer the question. Frank. - I wanted to kill myself- - Don't listen to him. - I was very unhappy. - He's sick in his head. - Richard! - I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation... - for a seven-year-old. - She's gonna find out anyway. - Okay. - Go on, Frank. Why were you unhappy? Um, well, there are a lot of reasons. Mainly, though, I fell in love with someone who didn't love me back. Who? One of my grad students. I was very much in love with him. Him? It was a boy? You fell in love with a boy? - Yes, I did. Very much so. - That's silly. You're right. It was silly. It was very, very silly. - There's another word for it. - Dad. - So, that's when you tried to kill yourself? - Well, no. The boy that I was in love with fell in love with another man- Larry Sugarman. - Who's Larry Sugarman? - Larry Sugarman is, perhaps... the second most highly regarded Proust scholar in the U.S. - Who's number one? - That would be me, Rich. - Really? - Mm-hmm. So that's when. No. What happened was I was a bit upset... so I said some things that I shouldn't have said... and I did some things that I shouldn't have done... and subsequently I was fired from my job... and forced to move out of my apartment and move into a motel. [Blowing Nose] - And that's when you tried to- - Well, no. Actually, all of that was okay. What happened was two days ago the MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom... awarded a genius grant to Larry Sugarman. And that's when l- Decided to check out early. Yes. Yes. And I failed at that as well. Olive, the important thing to understand here... is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself. He made a series of foolish choices- I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself... which is something winners never do. So that's the story, okay? Now, everyone, just let's move on and, uh- - [Sheryl Continues] - Is he always like this? How can you stand it? Olive, tell him about your routine while you're doing this. Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is a beauty contest for everyone in Albuquerque... but you have to be six or seven and you have to be a girl. This is our sister. - Cindy. - Spring break. Dwayne went to see his dad in Florida for two weeks... and Olive went to Laguna to see her cousins. - She made it to the top of the regionals out there. - I was in second place. Well, what do you think your chances are? I think I can win, because some of the other girls... they've been doing it longer, but I practice every day. - Yeah. Good luck. - Not about luck, Frank. Luck is the name losers give to their own failings. It's about wanting to win, willing yourself to win. - You've got to want it badder than anybody else. - I do. - Then you're gonna be a winner. - [Sheryl] Richard. It's the truth. It's the truth. You know, actually, there is a message from Cindy on the machine. Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine. - What? Little Miss Sunshine? - Yeah. What? - [Machine Beeps] - [Woman On Machine] Sheryl, it's Cindy. Remember when Olive was here last month? She was runner-up in the regional Little Miss Sunshine? Theyjust called right now and said that the girl who won had to forfeit her crown. I don't know why. Something about diet pills. - Now she has a place in the state contest in Redondo Beach! - [Screaming] - [Continues, Indistinct] - [Screaming Continues] Oh, my gosh! I won! I won! I won! I won! - [Richard] Finish your dinner! - I'm finished! - What happened? - I'm just calling to- Cindy! Yeah, we just got it. Yeah, she basically went crazy. - [Olive] I won! I won! I won! - No, I didn't get that. - The machine cut you off. Okay. - [Olive Continues, Indistinct] Redondo Beach. This Sunday? - Wh-Are you guys going? - [Whispering] Yes. - Can you put it off? - They have to. They have to. - Where does that leave us? - We can't do it. We can't. No, no- No, I understand that, Cindy. Yeah. - They- - I just- No, I'll just figure it out. Okay, bye-bye. It's this Sunday? Why can'tJeff and Cindy take her? They have some equestrian thing in Santa Barbara. You know, they do that horse shit every single weekend. Well, it's the nationals. They're taking both horses, so apparently it's a big deal. What about Olive? Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine! I won! I won! I'm going! We're going! - You promised? - We'll fly out and come back Monday. - How are you gonna get around out there? - We'll rent a car. - And stay at a hotel? - We can afford it. - This is our seed money. - Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in. - Don't start that. - It all goes to your nine steps! I told you I'm gonna talk to Stan Grossman! We're gonna get locked and loaded on this deal and start generating some income! - But in the meantime we've gotta be- - Okay, okay! We'll drive! - I'm not drivin'. - How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata? - Well, Grandpa does not have to come. - What? I coached her! I gave her the moves. I gotta go. - Why don't you take the V. W? - I cannot drive a shift. I tried. - We'll fly there. - We can't afford it. Well, that's what we're gonna do unless you have a better idea. Here. This is dessert. I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine! All right. I'll drive the bus. Richard, I was told explicitly not to leave Frank by himself. - No offense, Frank. - None taken. You got Dwayne here. They can look after each other. No, Richard! That's asking too much. If something happened- We can't go, then, unless Dwayne and Frank go with us. - [Olive] Mom, where's my bathing suit? - Right. Frank? - I found it! - [Door Slams] Okay. I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! Oh, Dwayne, come on, please. Think of your sister. [Richard] Come on, Dwayne. It'll be a lot of fun. You can go to the beach and- [Frank] ""This is unfair. ""All I ask is... that you leave me alone. "" Dwayne, flight school. I will give you permission for flight school. [Olive] I won! I won! I won! I won! I'm gonna win this one too! ""But I'm not going... to have any fun."" Yeah, we're all with you on that one, Dwayne. Grandpa! Grandpa! Is Grandpa coming to California? - We're all coming, honey. - [Richard] Hey, uh, hold on. Olive, come over here for a second. Come here. Sit down for a second. Look, there's no sense in entering a contest... if you don't think you're gonna win. So do you think you can win Little Miss Sunshine? Richard- Are you gonna win? Yes! We're going to California. [Laughs] Good night, Dwayne. [Writing] Not on your watch. I wouldn't do that to you. [Sighs] Thank you, Dwayne. Coming from you, that means a lot. Good night. Jesus, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. Do you know how tired I am? If some girl came up to me, begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it. - Dad? Watch the language, huh? - That's how tired I am. She's listening to music. Olive, I'll give you a million dollars if you turn around. - See? - All right. - But the rest of us. - Oh, the rest of you. Can I give you some advice? Well, I'm gonna give it to you anyway. - I don't want you making the same mistakes I made. - Can't wait to hear this. Dwayne-That's your name, right? Dwayne? This is the voice of experience talking. Are you listening? Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne. - Hey! Dad! - Not just one woman. A lot of women. - That's enough, all right? - Are you gettin' any? - Dad! - You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any? - Come on, please. - No? Jesus. You're what, 15? - My God, man! - Dad! You should be gettin'that young stuff. That young stuff is the best in the world. - Dad, that's enough! Stop it! - Will you kindly not interrupt! See, right now you're jailbait. They're jailbait. It's perfect. I mean, you hit 18- Man, you're talking about three to five. Hey, I will pull this truck over right now! So pull the truck over! Fuck you! I can say what I want. - I still got Nazi bullets in my ass! - Ah, the Nazi bullets! - You're as bad as those fuckers at Sunset Manor. - [Horn Toots] - What happened at Sunset Manor? - Frank, don't encourage him. I'll tell you what happened. I paid my money. They took my money. I should be able to do what the fuck I want! - He started snorting heroin. - You started snorting heroin? - I'm old! - Well, that stuff'll kill you. What am I, an idiot? And don't you start taking that shit. When you're young, you're crazy to do that stuff. - What about you? - I'm old. When you're old, you're crazy not to do it. We've tried. Believe me. The intervention was a fiasco. He's worse than a two-year-old. Can we please talk about something else? - [Frank] I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor. - Frank. Are you kidding me? It was a fuckin' paradise. They got a pool. They got golf. Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here, sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa. Look, I know you're a homo and all, but maybe you can appreciate this. You go to one of those places, there's four women for every guy. - Can you imagine what that's like? - You must've been very busy. Whoa! I had second-degree burns on my johnson. I kid you not. - Really? - Forget about it. What are you guys talking about? Politics. Oh. Fuck a lot of women, kid. I have no reason to lie to you. Not one woman. A lot of women. You heard what I said? Did it go in anywhere? [Richard] Yeah, I think we get the point, Dad. [Grandpa] Don't show me the pad. I don't want to see the fuckin' pad. Mom, how much can we spend? I would say four dollars. Anything under four dollars. Hi. You ready? Yeah, I'm gonna have the, uh, number five with coffee, please. All right. A number seven, over easy, and a grapefruit juice. - Grapefruit. Okay. - I would like a fruit plate. - And do you have chamomile? - Yes. - With honey, please. - [Frank] I would like the lumberjack and coffee. - And extra bacon. - Extra. - Now, Dad, you should probably- - Richard, don't start. - He's gonna kill himself. - Well, it's his life. - Thank you, Sheryl. - [Waitress] Garden salad? And you. - L- I'm sorry. I, um- Sorry. - Take your time. Don't apologize, Olive. It's a sign of weakness. Um, well, I want- Okay, okay. I know what I want. I know. Okay, can I get the waffles and, uh- I don't- What does ""alamodey"" mean? - Oh, that means it comes with ice cream. - Okay, ""alamodey"" then. - [Sheryl] Olive, for breakfast? - You said four dollars. Okay. You're right. Thank you. Okay. Be right back. Actually, Olive, ""? la mode""in French... translates literally as ""in the fashion."" ? la mode. ""Mode""is derived from Latin modus, meaning ""due or proper measure."" - Frank, shut up. - [Sheryl] Richard! Olive, can I tell you a little something about ice cream? - Yeah. - Well, ice cream is made from cream... which comes from cow's milk... and cream has a lot of fat in it. - Richard. - What? - She's gonna find out anyway, remember? - What? Find out what? Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat in the ice cream becomes fat in your body. - [Sheryl] Richard, I swear to God- - It's true. - What? What's wrong? - Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong. So if you eat a lot of ice cream, you might become fat. And if you don't, you're gonna stay nice and skinny, sweetie. - Mom- - Olive, Richard is an idiot. I like a woman with meat on her bones. [Olive] I don't- Why's everyone so upset? No, no one's upset, honey. L- I just want you to understand... it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay to be fat, if that's what you want to be. Whatever you want, it's okay. Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you this. Those women in Miss America- Are they skinny, or are they fat? Honey? Well, they're skinny, I guess. Yeah. I guess they don't eat a lot of ice cream. Okay. Coffee. Coffee. - Grapefruit. - Thank you. Chamomile. And here's your ice cream. ""Alamodey,"" right? I'll be back with your waffles in a second. Does anyone want my ice cream? Yeah, I'd like a little. Dwayne? Frank? - Olive's not gonna have her ice cream. - Do you mind if I have a little? - Yeah, let's dig in. - That looks really good. [Grandpa] Boy, I feel sorry for anybody... that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream so early in the morning. - Boy, that looks good. - You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive? Those waffles are gonna be awful lonely in there. - Mmm! Mmm! - Watch this. Wait! Stop! Don't eat it all. - All right, Olive- - Richard! - Hey, Stan! - [Truck Horn Honks] Stan, it's Richard. Again. Listen, I know you're busy... but we're just dying to hear what sort of numbers you came up with in Scottsdale. - So, uh, give me a call, please. - Hey, did you get him? - No, I can't get a signal out of this thing. - [Groans] How long till we get there? - A long time, honey. - I know. But how long? Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving today and 200 tomorrow. - That's a lot of driving. Let's go. - I'll drive for a while. - No, no. I got it. - No. I gotta learn how to do this. You're doing it. How hard can it be? [Gears Grinding] - Push the stick down hard. - I'm pushing hard. - [Grinding Continues] - Okay. Okay, there you go. Now push the clutch in all the way to the floor. It's on the floor. The floor. - [Grunting] - [Grinding Continues] [Muttering] Sticking on there. - Push down hard. - [Grunting] [Man] Well, you've got a problem. Your clutch is, uh, shot. Can we get a new one? These old buses, you- you have to order the part. How long does it take? Well, it's the weekend... so... maybe... Thursday. - [Panting] - [Dog Barking] [Groans] Is there a, uh, dealership around here? Well, uh, they're probably gonna be closed. It's, uh- It's the weekend, you know. Yes, we're aware of that. I'll tell you what. You know these- these old buses? You don't need the clutch to change from- from the third to the fourth. You only really need the clutch to go from number one to number two. But as long as you keep parking on a hill... and you let it go, and it goes 15, 20 miles per hour... you start her in third, and you go from third to fourth. What if you're not on a hill? There's no hill. What if there's no hill? What do you- Yeah, it's- Olive, Dad, I want you in the car first. - I know. We know. - All right, here we go! Everybody push! All right. Here we go! Push! Push! - [Grunting] - Ok- Ok- Okay! I just want everyone here to know... that I am the preeminent Proust scholar in the United States. - Here we go! - [Engine Starts] - [Sheryl] Go on, honey. - I'm putting it in gear! - Go, honey! - [Richard] Come on! Come on, Olive! Run! Run! Come on! - Come on! - Sheryl, let's go! - [Screaming] - Sheryl! - Frank, let's go! - I'm coming. - [Sheryl] You're losing them. Slow down! - I can't slow down! - Come on! Come on! Come on, you dumb bastard! - I can't. I can't slow down. - I can't slow down! - Let's go! [Sheryl] Help him. Come on! Come on. Come on. Get in. - [Sheryl Screams, Laughs] - [Frank] No one gets left behind. - [Sheryl] Close the door! - No one gets left behind! Outstanding, soldier! Outstanding! [Laughs] Outstanding. - Was that fun? - Yeah. [Laughs] [Richard] So finally I'm just sitting there... and I decide, you know, ""This is Stan Grossman. What the hell?"" And I start pitching him the nine steps. And about- I don't know- two minutes in, he stops me, he says... ""I can sell this."" [Frank] Mm-hmm. Interesting. Yeah, and this is the guy who knows how to do it. You start with a book, and then you do a media tour, corporate events, DVD, VHS series. I mean, there's a whole fascinating science into how you roll these things out. - Wow. - Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale right now, you know... building the buzz and kind of getting the whole hype thing going. He's doing what the pros call a ticking clock auction. Oh, how about that! Yeah, and I can detect that note of sarcasm there, Frank. What sarcasm? I didn't- I didn't hear it. But I want you to know something. I feel sorry for you. You do? Good. Yeah, I do. Because sarcasm is the refuge oflosers. - It is? Really? - Yep. Sarcasm is losers trying to bring winners down to their level... and that's step four in the program. Wow, Richard, you've really opened my eyes to what a loser I am. - How much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom? - That one's on the house. - Okay, you guys, that's enough. - It's on the house. - That was for free? - No charge. No charge. - Stop it! - He started it. - [Cell Phone Rings] - That's- Oh, wait a second. - [Sheryl] You are so bad. - Quiet. This is it. This is that call. He-Hello? Stan? Stan? [Chattering In Spanish] Stan Grossman? Richard Hoover. [Laughs] Finally. How're ya doin'? No, I know. We were, uh, on the highway, and I lost you on my cell. Forget about it. How'd we do? Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies' room. You need to go? No. I'm gonna go practice my routine over there. Okay, well, don't go too far. [Richard] Well, I think that wejust gotta talk to him a little. No, you gotta talk to him. No, Stan, listen to me. Hold on now. I am going to get something to drink. You want anything? - Stay positive and-[Continues, Indistinct] - Yeah, get me some porn. [Chuckles] Okay. Get me something really nasty too. I don't want any of that airbrushed shit. - Okay. - Okay, here's a 20. Get yourself a little treat too. - Get yourself a fag rag. - [Laughs] All right. I will. - Uh, that one. Yes. And that one. - [Bell Chimes] And I would like that one- No, down. Yes. Yes. Yes. I would like that one. And, uh, I will have a- a blue raspberry Slushee. Frank? Oh, my God! How are you? - Uh- - I thought you were gonna be in Santa Fe for the conference. - I was looking for you. - [Bell Chimes] - Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven? - Yeah. - Well, you heard about Larry and the whole genius thing, right? - Yeah. - It's official. - Oh, good. So we're going to this private spa in Sedona for the week- - Larry's here? - Yeah. - He's out filling the tank. He's, uh- - Oh. Yeah, there he is. Wow. I can't believe this. How have you been? I've been fine. Good. Good. You know, I heard that you got fired. Yeah. No, I quit, 'cause enough is enough, you know? Right. Good. Good. [Chuckles] So what are you up to now? Um, I'm weighing my options... and, um, just, you know, taking some time off, and so- Great. That's great. $ 19.79, sir. [Man Singing Country] So- - Well, it was great to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Bye. [Singing Continues] [Clerk] Hey. - You forgot your Slushee. - [Horn Honks] [Continues] You're in Scottsdale right now, right? Okay, I can come by. I'm gonna be coming through there. I could swing right by. We could- Christ. He's not getting it. [Richard] Did you try that? Listen to what I'm saying, Stan! I'll-I'll- [Bell Chimes] So what happened? Nothing. Let's get out of here. Wait a minute. I thought you said this was a done deal. - He said it was a done deal. - What, you didn't get anything? Oh, my God! Where does that leave us? Fucked. That's where it leaves us. - I can't believe I'm hearing- Did you even try negotiating? - Yes! Of course I tried! What do you think l- Let's just go, okay? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! ""Where's Olive?"" Oh! - [Horn Honks] - All right, Frank. - Come on, Olive. - Come on, Olive. Come on, sweetie, jump. Jump in the car. - We can't stop. Jump. - I got her! I got her! [Sheryl Whoops] Richard. Yeah. Whatever happens, you tried to do something on your own... which is more than most people ever do... and I include myself in that category. You took a big chance. That took guts, and I'm proud of you. Okay, Dad. Thank you. Thank you, Dad. Okay, here is 11. Frank, you're 12. And Grandpa's 13. Can I sleep with Grandpa tonight? Well, you'll have to ask Grandpa. - Grandpa? - I got two beds. You could still use some rehearsing. [Olive] Yeah, that's what I was thinking. [Richard] All right, everybody, we have a long day tomorrow. I'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a.m. That means no lollygagging. We need to be packed and on the road by 7:40, guys. - [Sheryl] Frank, you guys'll be okay? - [Frank] Yeah, we're fine. - Okay, well, good night. - Good night. - Sleep tight. - Okay. What a fucking nightmare. [Door Closes] Richard, we- we have to talk. Please. Sheryl, let's just get through this and go home. [Sheryl] No, Richard, we have to talk now! [Richard] I tried to tell you we couldn't afford this trip! - Do you realize we're becoming bankrupt? - We are not bankrupt! - [Arguing Continues] - Hey, don't listen to that. Let's turn on the tube. - We agree that the right man to preserve the traditions- - I'm gonna brush my teeth. Secretary Rumsfeld and I thought long and hard... about this important choice. To me- [Sheryl] You said this was a lock! You said it was a done deal! [Richard] Stan Grossman said it was a done deal! [Sheryl] I'm not married to Stan Grossman! [Richard] I trusted him! You gotta trust to be trusted! That's step six! [Sheryl] Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard! They're not working! Forget it! It's over! I never want to hear about the nine steps again! - [Growling] - [Growling] - [Snarling] - [Snarling] - [Growls] - [Growls] Perfect. Perfect. You're the world champion growler. Time for your beauty rest. Get in there. There you go. Good night. - Grandpa? - Yeah. I'm kinda scared about tomorrow. Are you kiddin' me? You're gonna blow 'em out of the water. They're not gonna know what hit 'em. - Grandpa? - Yeah. Am I pretty? Olive, you are... the most beautiful girl in the whole world. Nah, you're just saying that. No, I'm not. I'm madly in love with you. And it's not because of your brains or your personality. It's because you're beautiful, inside and out. - Grandpa? - What? - I don't want to be a loser. - You're not a loser. Where'd you get the idea you're a loser? [Crying] Because Daddy hates losers. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up a minute. You know what a loser is? A real loser is somebody that's so afraid of not winning, they don't even try. - Now, you're trying, right? - Yeah. Well, then, you're not a loser. We're gonna have fun tomorrow, right? Yeah. [Sniffles] We can tell 'em all to go to hell. Good night, sweetie. I love you. [Sighs] What are you doing? I'm gonna fix this. Richard- I'm gonna fix this. [Door Opens, Closes] Here we go. Here we go. - [Engine Starts] - [Tires Screech] [Horn Beeps] [Chattering] Hi. [Chattering] Hi. Stan Grossman, please. Stan, it's Richard. I don't know where the fuck you are. I'm at the hotel. Call me. [Phone Beeping] [Line Ringing] [Chattering Continues] [Cell Phone Ringing] But it's funny. So I said, ""You want me to teach you about life experiences? You can write a book about my experiences."" - So he says to me- - [Line Ringing] Hello, Stan. You're the one that said it would sell! That's what I thought at the time. But it's a great program. You said so yourself. I don't understand. It's not the program, Richard. It's you. Okay? No one's heard of you. Nobody cares. What's the next step? There is none. We had our shot. It didn't fly. We move on. - You-You mean give up? - Richard. Hey, wh-Whoa, hey! One setback here, and you're ready to just quit? Richard, listen. I pushed this thing hard, okay? I rammed it down their fucking throats, and no one bought it! It's time to move on. You're not gonna win this one. Okay. Okay. You know what? Good. I'm glad. You know why? Because this is what the nine steps are all about. - Right here, Stan. Right here! - Richard. - Richard, please. - You blew it! You blew it. You're out. [Horn Honking] [Olive] Mom? Dad? [Sighs] What is it, hon? Grandpa won't wake up. [Siren Wailing] [Chattering On P.A.] Want to take an eye test? Uncle Frank? An eye test? Olive, come here. Put those away. We're gonna have a family meeting. Dwayne, family meeting. [P.A. Chattering Continues] First of all... the doctors are doing everything they can to help Grandpa right now. He's had a long, eventful life... and I know he loves both of you very much. But if God wants to take him, we have to be ready to accept that, okay? Whatever happens, we're a family. And what's important is that we love each other. I love you guys so, so much. [Sheryl Sobbing] [Chattering On TV] [Man On TV] Look at this. This is a 15-pound turkey. It does it in three hours' time. [Infomercial Continues, Indistinct] Are you the family of Edwin Hoover? Yes. I'm sorry. We did everything we could. He was, uh- Well, it was too much. He probably just fell asleep and never woke up. I'll have someone come talk to you about handling the remains. Thank you. [Infomercial Continues, Indistinct] Linda! [Chattering On P.A.] Mom? Is Grandpa dead? Yeah, honey. He passed away. [Both Sobbing] [Man On TV] That's what this machine does. Chicken, fish or beef. So you always look forward to eating the food. And that, I believe- [Continues, Indistinct] Put it in the machine. Center it. Turn it around. Hi. I'm your bereavement liaison, Linda. - My consolations for your loss. - Thank you. Okay, these are the forms you need to fill out. A death certificate. A report of death. An M.E. Pink slip. Please try and be as detailed as possible. Um, this is a brochure... for a grief recovery support group that meets on Tuesdays. And, if you like, at this time, I can refer you to a funeral home... so you can begin making your own arrangements. Actually, prearrangements have already been made in Albuquerque. - Albuquerque? - We're actually on our way to California right now. If the body is crossing state lines, you're gonna need a burial transit permit. Okay, but we're trying to get to Redondo Beach by 3:00. 3:00 today? Hmm. Ain't gonna happen. Okay, um, can I just- I know that this is, uh- this might be a little unusual... but if maybe we could just go. And then we'll come back, and we'll take care of all the paperwork and- No. You can't just abandon the body. No, no, no. Nobody's gonna abandon the body. We're gonna go and- Otherwise, the hospital becomes responsible. Sir, there are ways we have of doing things. We're gonna go and come back. You are not the only one that's had somebody die here today, okay? Is there any way we might be able to view the remains? We haven't had a chance to move him downstairs... so someone may come in in a few minutes to take him to the basement. Just tell them who you are, and they will wait. - Thank you. - Okay? And when you're done with the paperwork, I'll be at the nurses' station. - Great. Thank you, Linda. - Thank you. [P.A. Beeps] [Chattering On P.A.] [Chattering On P.A.] Goddamn it, Dad. Goddamn it! Stupid. We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine next year, okay, honey? Next year. [Sheryl Sobbing] No. No. We've come 700 miles. I will be damned if I'm not making that contest, Sheryl. Well, Richard, we can't leave him here. We're not gonna leave him. - Richard, what are you doing? - Fuck. - Dwayne, go around outside. - Richard, what are you thinking? - We're gonna take him with us. - No, no. That is not happening. He's better off with us that these people. I want you to go around outside and underneath this window. Dwayne, don't you dare move. Honey, you stay here. We'll take Olive. Frank can drive. No, Sheryl, we'll be there in two hours. I'll call a funeral home once we get there. If there's one thing my father would have wanted... it's to see Olive perform in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Now, I believe we'd be doing a grave disservice to his memory... if we were to just give up now. All right? There's two kinds of people in this world. There's winners and there's losers. Okay? You know what the difference is? Winners don't give up. So what are we here? Are we winners, or are we losers? Huh? Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. You guys go. Olive, you watch the curtain.

Did you choose this? - No, my grandpa did. - Your grandpa? - Mm-hmm. - Which track? - Twelve. We were drivin' five, six hours. Thought he was napping. By the time we figured it out, it's- - You know. - Too late. So where's the body? Um- Personal effects. - Thank you. - You take care. - You too. - [Doors Close] - [Audience Murmuring] - [Girl] I'm ready. - [Audience Murmuring] - [Girl] I'm ready. - [Man] She was scared, but she did very well. - [Woman] Was she? [Fanfare] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 24th annual... Little Miss Sunshine Pageant! - [Cheering] - Yes! Now, please, put your hands together once again and help me welcome to the stage... our 12 beautiful contestants! - [Cheering] - [Applause] [Pop] [Woman Singing] [Continues] Wow. [Chuckles] [Ends] Oh, let's have a big round of applause for our lovely contestants! At the end of the evening, one of these girls... will be crowned Little Miss Sunshine! Olive, honey, are you okay in there? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey. What? - You got a kid in the show? - [Emcee Singing] Your first time? Yeah, yeah. [Continues] [Ends] America! It's so beautiful! [Dwayne] Sometimes I just wish I could go to sleep till I was 18... and skip all this crap- high school and everything-just skip it. You know Marcel Proust? - He's the guy you teach. - Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads. But he's also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he, uh- he gets down to the end of his life... and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered- Those were the best years of his life, 'cause they made him who he was. All the years he was happy? You know, total waste. Didn't learn a thing. So, if you sleep until you're 18... ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss. I mean, high school? High school- Those are your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that. You know what? Fuck beauty contests. Life is one fucking beauty contest after another. You know, school, then college, then work? Fuck that. And fuck the Air Force Academy. If I wanna fly, I'll find a way to fly. You do what you love, and fuck the rest. I'm glad you're talkin' again, Dwayne. - You're not nearly as stupid as you look. - [Sighs] [Clicks Tongue] Wanna go back? - Not really. - [Chuckles] Yeah, we should go back. [Emcee] And now, the moment we've all been waiting for- the talent competition. [Applause] [Piano] [Singing] Miss Carly Nugent. [Woman Singing Disco] [Ends] [Yodeling] [Singing] Yee-haw!

Yeah, right. See ya. [Zipper Zips] Oh, look at you. Is that your costume? Mm-hmm. - [Sighs] - Okay, here. - Hey, what's goin' on? - Oh, I just- I came to wish Olive good luck. - How you doin', honey? - Good. - Nervous. - Yeah. You're gonna do great. [Kisses] I just know it. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - What's up? - [Sighs] I don't want her to go on. [Girl Singing] - Are you authorized to be backstage? - No. Hey. - Where are the dressing rooms? - [Girl] Are you allowed to be here? Just tell me where the dressing rooms are. - [Door Closes] - Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore. - Hey, how are you feeling? - Better. Where's Olive? - There. What's up? - Mom, I don't want Olive doing this. Oh, my God! - Look around. This place is fucked! - He's right! Look, I don't want these people judging Olive. Fuck them! - Listen, it is too late. - No, it's not too late. You're the mom... and you're supposed to protect her. Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom. Please don't let her do this. [Woman] Olive Hoover, two minutes. [Dwayne] Look, she's not a beauty queen. She's just not. - I'm gonna tell her. - No, Dwayne. You listen to me. Olive is who she is. She has worked so hard. She's poured everything into this. We can't just take it away from her. We can't. I know you wanna protect her. I know, honey, but... we gotta let Olive be Olive. - [Door Opens] - Olive Hoover. Are you the family? Yeah. Okay? Olive, it's time. Okay? Yeah. - We gotta go now. - Hang on. Olive, look at me. If you don't want to do this, that's okay. If you want to sit this one out, it's totally fine by us. We're proud of you anyway. We gotta go. It's time. [Techno, Faint] Ready? Let's go. Good luck, honey. Copy that. Twenty-five is performance ready... and we're walkin'... as fast as we can. - Is she going on? - Yeah. She's going on. [Emcee] Pure fairy-tale magic. Miss Charisma Whiteman! Wasn't that a stardust fantasy? Thank you for that. You have been such a patient audience. We have one more contestant, and then we'll be crowning our winner. Please give a warm welcome to... Miss... Olive Hoover! [Applause] [Whispers] You okay? Um, I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa... who showed me these moves. [Emcee] Oh, that is so sweet! [Laughs] Is he here? Where is your grandpa right now? In the trunk of our car. Okay! [Laughs] Well, take it away, Olive! [Funk] Huh! [Man Singing] [Continues] - [Continues] - [Woman] You suck! - [Audience Members Booing] - Those little fuckers. I will kill them. [Woman] You stink! No, no, no, no, no.

[No Audible Dialogue] [Clears Throat] Okay, you're out- on the condition that you never enter your daughter in a beauty pageant... in the state of California ever again. Ever. I think we can live with that. All right. We're back in business. Lock and load. Olive, your grandpa would've been really proud of you. - Yeah, you were great. Mm-wah! - [Frank] You were beyond great. - [Dwayne] You were incredible. - Thank you. Let's get outta here. [Panting] [Grunting] [Gasping] Whoo! - It's in gear. - [Engine Starts] What in the world?

No its dark and we are shooting at him and he's running who can see? Hey,how about How about shutting up,you have done enough talking If you been on your toes this wouldn't have happened We figure as soon as things calm down we'll spread out and start looking Well,gentlemen I see no advantage in continuing this conversation now You will not of course leave town I'll be in touch with you shortly You with your big mouth,you almost ruined everything What you take me for?Why didn't you tell him about finding Nevin's bracelet? Look,kid,shut up let me doing the thinking for both of us you know what we get for this lousy safe job That doll is mixed up in a killing that bracelet is got to be worth a minimum of hundred grands with no hot jewellery to peddle The jeweler actually saw the bracelet yesterday,Mrs Nevins why did you not report this loss at once? It happened just a few days before I don't know whether it was a restaurant or a show we’ve been to Would have reported it sooner except with my husband's death I forgot about it We have a description of the bracelet, we already put out a bulletin The one point we never been able to clear up,Mrs Nevins,is the motive On the evening of his death Mr Nevins made an appointment with his lawyer on an urgent business matter You drove him to the office but he left almost at once without even talking with Mr Franklin He left in a rented car There must have been some very pressing reason.You have an explanation? I had very little to do with my husband's business affairs It appears to have been a personal affair,Mrs Nevins It's often difficult to separate business affairs and personal ones I beg you pardon Nothing.It's just that my husband never discussed business What would I have known of anything of my husband's personal affairs? She would know if there was another woman involved This trip you planned to take was it a reconciliation? Whatever it was,it doesn't matter now,Ralph is dead That's why we are asking these questions,Mrs Nevins One reason for a man to rent a car is to avoid detection Tell me did Mr Nevins had something to hide? Did you suspect another woman? Perhaps you even followed him once Did you Mrs Nevins? Who was that woman? Please I can't tell you anymore Mrs Nevins, a moment ago you said it was sometimes difficult to separate business and private affairs That could mean someone connected with his business was it his secretary? I think we better have a talk with her That's not fair.I can't accuse someone of murder just because she was close to him Do you happen to accuse her of the murder,have you,Mrs Nevins? You leave the accusations to us,that's our job Sorry if we disturbed you,Mrs Nevins Hello Who? If this is the lady who has been calling he is said to tell you he is not here -Hi,boy -Mrs Rycker You get a prize if you finnish the bowl by noon No lectures,Phyl There are no lectures.Tell me something, Paulie,what are you trying to prove? I saw the two gentlemen callers as I came in,they looked like a lot of laugh Six months for talking to myself You don't mind me taking a swim,do you? Unfortunately I can't convince Tom that a plumbing contractor is in the swimming pool class Though we do have a sensational bathroom Paulie,this is the first laugh I ever heard out of you in days come on,come on in with me It's really good,you could use all that water to chase the Scotch As a matter of fact I need the exercise, my waste line is getting a little aggressive you know what I mean? Bathing caps,ruin your social life after five You're ready Hey,doesn't it feel great? Paulie,the police have been to see me so Tom is getting jealous I haven't told them anything because I don't know anything but all that's doing is hurting you Is there something I can do to help you? No,thanks, though no OK Mrs Nevins? Instead of that old cliche ""haven't I seen you some place before"" I'm going to ask you just the opposite haven't you seen me somewhere? What do you want? I think we both want the same thing Phyl I want you I just remembered I had a very important engagement A little older than I figured,but I suppose he has hidden talents Phyl You don't have to explain to me,next to nothing,expected something a little younger Paulie I had a most divine afternoon I can't say I'd love to to stay to have a drink, but you can't talk me into it You know how it is to have million things to do as a matter of fact Tom is having some guests for dinner,out of town you know how that is,I'll check with you You are a most unlikely hijacker I should think you could get anything you wanted just for the asking I won't trouble you with the details of how I finally traced you and deduced that you murdered your late husband I shall come at once at the important point I'd like to have my jewellery back Your jewellery? It was Mrs Lynbury's jewellery Indeed.Well you see,Mrs Nevins I am doctor Lynbury Doubtless you will want me to be seated I believe I can speak in perfect confidence with you because we are in the same boat so to speak,honor among thieves If you really are Dr Lynbury,what was you doing robbing your own home? That Mrs Nevins is really an interesting story unfortunately the talented people are not always the wealthy people have you not noticed that? I had talent but no money until I married Mrs Lynbury charming woman you must meet her she inherited among other things a splendid collection of jewellery Do sit down,Mrs Nevins After I married it was unnecessary for me to work but I couldn't bear to think of myself as a parasite So I copied my wife's entire jewellery collection in payson stone I sold the real gems one by one You mean all those jewellery we got was false? Not false in reference to such superior workmanship It's true the stones you hijacked were copies but it would take an expert to spot them I wonder if I might have a little of this soda water No ice To return to my story having disposed of the real gems it occurred to me that it might be possible to reap a double profit So I arranged for the payson jewellery to be stolen so that I may collect the insurance It was at this point you entered the picture and muddled up what should have been a magnificently simple job You can understand how awkward it would be if it were discovered that the jewels were false I would be faced with the charge of fraud by the insurance people you of course would be faced with a murder charge Naturally nothing we say here would go any further What I'm asking is not at all unreasonable since in any case the jewels are worthless to you I can return to you something of real value I could have improved upon the design but it is rather well made I don't have the jewels I hope,Mrs Nevins,that you are not going to make any trouble because I assure you I have had no compunction against killing you You are going to make trouble all right but not the way you think You want that junk back go ahead and get it Where? At Mr EV Marshall n152 Marquia Apartment 305 Gentlemen,what can I do for you We're interested in the little lady outside,Cathy Stevens How did she and Nevins get along socially? Come on,Lieutenant,what's on your mind? It's just we have reasons to believe she was more than a secretary to him Cathy and Ralf Nevins? Ridiculous After you've been doing the work I do for a while,nothing sounds ridiculous Mrs Nevins doesn't think so? Mrs Nevins told you this? Certainly,it would explain things,wouldn't it? Nevins was carrying on an affair with his secretary then he decided to break up with her and take his wife for a long trip Secretary knew where he kept the gun went with him to a deserted mountain spot and shot him That is ridiculous Happens every day Mrs Nevins is lying Why should she lie? What else could she possibly have against Stevens? It's just not true Ask Miss Stevens to come in,please Look,In tell you she did not know anything about this We are paid to make our own decisions Ask her to come in,please Miss Stevens would you come in please Stevens,would you tell us again what you did on the night Mr Nevins was killed I went home.I went straight home from the office What did you do? I suppose I went to sleep Cathy,what they want to know.. Let Miss Stevens tell her own story,Mr Marshall You went home and went to sleep. Can anyone confirm that? I live alone,Sergeant About what time was it when you went to sleep? I don't know it was late Can you recall what you did between the time you arrived home and the time you went to sleep? Let's see.I washed out a few things, I fixed dinner,I watched television And then what did you do? I took a shower and I went to bed But you didn't go to sleep right away? No,not right away And you never left your apartment at any time that night? I didn't say that Suppose you say it now? Did you or did you not leave your apartment that night? Yes,I did Where did you go? To Mr Marshall's apartment I see I'm sorry Let's put this right up the creek It was a good try,Cathy,but why? They never believe that I'm sorry.I had to try to give you an alibi Give me an alibi? Yes.You were there.Both of you were there You and Mrs Nevins He was going to kill her.And you killed him to save her What makes you say that? I heard the recording he had made The one you had erased You knew From the beginning?

What about Marsh? He wouldn't even say what's wrong Who? Cathy is not here either, she must have left with him Do what you want 350000$ we were going to sell them Cut yourself off from your home and your family You must have loved her very much I'd like to be million miles away from here So I could start over I wouldn't answer that phone if I were you I'll take that briefcase,please Just a minute,doctor Let's have a look at this Must have been a fortune in here I suppose you gentlemen You can follow us all right,polite,let's go I may as well tell you the whole story Yes,inspector,yes we'll keep watch Don't let her slip through your fingers Allen and Jennings are on their way Yes,inspector -Hello -Hi I feel ill,Phyl Paulie,what's the matter with you,you sound beefed More than that.I'm going away, Phyllis,I don't know where,just go away Listen Paulie.Don't do anything foolish. You've been in that before and believe me you can get over it (Phyllis)Besides there is no point running away I'm glad you came back Yes I came back.You made sure I would win you told the police about Cathy,that was a rotten line thing to do I'm sorry I was jealous I wanted to hurt you in anyway I could, I do not know why I acted the way I did I don't know why do the most of things I do Don't start feeling sorry for yourself, Paulie,there isn't time Not anymore It took me until now to see you as you really are I get a good look at myself Look.We can still get away Forget about the money.Forget everything.I only want you I've got a little money of my own,enough to let us go out of the country I know it sounds crazy coming from me,but I want to start over,start clean Clean? Are we supposed to forget that Ralph is dead? Nothing you can do will change that, nothing can wash away that kind of dirt Don't you give me that holy stuff, what are you,some kind of a martyr You're just as guilty as I am You were rotten from the beginning,Paulie, you are nothing but a cheap ordinary Sorry Marsh We shouldn't be fighting darling what's done is done, we can't change anything we have to make the best of it, all that matter is that you're here You want me,you can't deny it, or you wouldn't come back Oh,darling as long as we love each other I was in love with someone I thought you were Someone wonderful,someone I dreamed of I'll be like that,Marsh I'll do anything you want, we'll start all over again like there has been never any other people,no one but us As long as you live you will never even understand what I thought you were I'm sorry,Paulie,but it is too late He is right,Mrs Nevins,it is too late You called them?

Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) - full transcript,An African-American Mafia hit man who models himself after the samurai of old finds himself targeted for death by the mob.,"""Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, ""one should meditate upon being ripped apart ""by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, ""being carried away by surging waves, ""being thrown into the midst of a great fire, ""being struck by lightning, ""being shaken to death by a great earthquake, ""falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease ""or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. "" I'll get you the rest tomorrow. No problem. 'Listen, Frank... 'Don't fuck around with the boss's daughter. ' 'Don't break my balls, Uncle Joe. ' 'Asshole, listen to me. 'She's been in and out of psychiatric hospitals. - 'She's a wacko. ' - 'Yeah, yeah... ' 'Vargo has put the family money in her trust fund. ' 'I already know. ' 'You'll get clipped. ' Are you finished yet, Uncle Joe? - 'You'll get whacked!' - I'm not fu... I'm not fucking dead yet, so let's get off the goddamn phone. 'Are you listening? That girl's a fucking wacko. ' 'Yeah, I know. ' 'Vargo's crazy about her. - 'You know what ""crazy"" means?' - 'Yeah, I know, Uncle Joe. ' Excuse me, Mr Vargo. Sonny... Louie Bonacelli's outside, said you told him to come. Thanks, Angie. - Excuse me, I'll be right back. - OK. - I almost hit the number. - What did you play? I played my license plate number. You know what? My fucking house-address number came out! Hey... - Louie. - What's up, Sonny? Come on, let's take a walk. - Everything's set up? - Yeah. It's going down tonight. I'm using my special guy. What about the girl? Morini put her on the bus... to the seashore. - Good. - I don't feel good about it. Handsome Frank's a made guy and all. A good soldier. - I feel a little bad. - Forget about it. Handsome Frank fucked up. Pay your respects at the funeral. Yeah... 'Home in!' 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. ' Have some more wine, Louise. I don't want any more wine. What the fuck? What do you want? My Rolex? Whatever... Did my father send you here to do this? It's a good book. Ancient Japan was a pretty strange place. You can have it. I'm finished with it. I've got a bad feeling, Vin. First Valerio calls me in for a sit-down with Vargo himself. And now the bird. Here, birdy-birdy. Come here, you little fucker. Goddammit, this is ridiculous. I can't write this small. Can't we swag a fax machine and get it to this guy? It ain't the Middle Ages. Come here, birdy. I got him, Louie! Louie, I got him. I got the sucker. Little fucker, here we go. Easy now, Mr Chicken, easy. Mother of Jesus, Vin, hold it still! I don't want to hurt him. - Ready? - Yeah, OK. Go home, little birdy, go home. 'Shit! Shit!' 'What's going on? What's the problem here?' You little brat! You want us to come up there? Fuck you! Then you gonna get it! - You little prick! - Eat me! Cocksucker. Hey, Louie. What the fuck are you guys doing? His mother went to work and locked him in. He's mad as hell. Vargo's waiting for us. You've got bigger problems than this. Johnny, you said the girl was on the fucking bus last night. - What happened? - She was. I don't know what happened. Let's go. Come on, Vin, let's go. - Ghost Dog! - Knowledge to knowledge, baby. Shit! How you doin'? How are you? They're inside, waiting for you. - Condolences on Handsome Frank. - Thank you. - My thoughts are with you, Joe. - They're waiting for you. - I'm sorry about Frank. - Thank you. Sorry about your nephew, kid. They whacked him. What are you gonna do? That's the way it goes. - Hey. Go in, they're waiting. - Thanks. Louie, how's it going? I'm sorry we're late, Mr Vargo. Mr Bonacelli was... delayed on his way over. Sit down. Johnny, step outside, have a smoke. Sure, Sonny. Mr Vargo. We got a big problem here. Seems like you're responsible. Your mystery man fucked up. Morini told me he put the girl... .. Mr Vargo's daughter, on the bus. He did... but she got off and went to Handsome Frank's house. You wanted Handsome Frank whacked... So he got whacked. From outside. I set it all up. No traces, no nothing. Morini said that she was on the bus. Jesus, it's lucky he didn't do her, too. Right? If he had, you would be fucking dead. - This is not a good situation. - Where is she? Is she OK? Don't worry about Mr Vargo's daughter. We need to eliminate the scumbag who whacked Frank. Frank was one of us. His killer needs to be... neutralised. Erased from the planet. For the past four years, he's done maybe 12 perfect contracts. Perfect. Like a ghost. He's valuable. Totally untraceable. If he'd realised anyone would be there, he'd have backed off. He sure didn't know that she was gonna... be there. Louie, unless you wanna be buried next to Frank, tell us everything about this mysterious, ghostlike, untraceable fuckin' button man. OK, OK. Er, let's see... I don't pay him by the job. He'll only work if I pay once a year on the first day of autumn. First day of autumn, I settle up for that past year, see? The first day of autumn... OK, OK. Let's skip that part. Where does he live? Fucked if I know. That's the next strange thing. I can't call him. He contacts me only through a bird. Since I first started contracting stuff out to him, the bird comes every single day. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Did you say he contacts you through a fucking bird? Did I just hear that? What particular species... of bird? It's a pigeon. It must be a carrier pigeon or whatever. Passenger pigeon! They've been extinct since 1914! Am I fucking dreaming here or what? OK, Louie, forget about the bird. Let me ask you this. Tell me, what does this mysterious guy look like? He's a big guy. A big black guy. - He's what? - He said the guy's a nigger! Maybe eight years ago, I saw a guy, this guy. 'He was a kid in a bad situation. ' Stupid-ass motherfucker! Get his ass up here! You motherfucker! What's the problem here? 'So I... straightened things out. ' Anyway, about four years ago, this big guy comes to my door. This black guy, got a fucking pigeon on his shoulder. Fuck knows how he found me, but he said he owed me. I only saw him once after that and we made this arrangement. That's very touching, Louie. Let me just backtrack for a second. The bird comes to your house every day. Did he come today? Yes, the bird was there this morning. Did he have a message? The usual ""mission accomplished"" message. Uh-huh. And did you send a message back? No. You'd called me in, so I figured it was best to leave it alone. Did you follow this bird? Put a bug on it? Anything like that? No, I never had a reason to do anything like that. I realise the arrangement I made with this guy is pretty weird, but he's always shown me complete respect. A whole new century is coming, and Mr Vargo wants every member of this family to make it a priority to erase this weirdo. This guy is a professional. Going after him could be dangerous. Handsome Frank was one of us, so we're gonna peel this nigger's cap back. Better him than you, right? Now, what the fuck is his name? - Ghost Dog. - What? - Ghost Dog. - Ghost Dog? - He said Ghost Dog! - He calls himself Ghost Dog. A lot of these black guys, gangster type guys, they all got names like that. - Is that true? - He means like the rappers. The rappers got names like that - Snoop Doggy Dogg, Ice Cube, Q-Tip, Method Man. My favourite was always Flavor Flav from Public Enemy. He got the funky fresh fly flava. ""Live lyrics from the bank of reality. ""I kick da flyest dope manoeuvre technicality, to a dope track. "" - I love that guy. - I know nothing about that, but it makes me think about Indians. They've got names like Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, Running Bear, Black Elk... - That kind of shit. - Indians, niggers... same thing! - Johnny! - Sonny? Mr Vargo? Go outside. Get Sammy the Snake, Joe Rags, Big Angie. - Get 'em in here. - Right away. Yes! Hey! Peace, Dog! Is that your dog? No. I thought maybe it was your dog. What? What? He's really staring at you. - Maybe he wants my ice cream. - I don't think so. If he's bothering you, why not tell him to go away? Go on. I've seen you before... 'cause you always carry that briefcase. You live on the roof of the building down from me, where the birds fly out from. Mom says you talk to nobody and you got no friends. - I don't know your mom. - Is it true? What? You never talk to nobody and you got no friends. - No, I'm talking to you, right? - Yeah. Right. You got your lunch in that box? - What you got in the briefcase? - I asked you first. No. Not my lunch. I got my books. You wanna see? Books? Yeah, OK. ""The Wind in the Willows"". I read that. - You did? - Yeah. Toad Hall and that stuff. It was great. You did read it. ""The Souls of Black Folk"". I read that, too. Where did you get that? From Ms Andrews, my teacher. I didn't read all of it, but I plan to. You got time. ""Night Nurse""?! - You read that? - No, I just like the cover. Right... ""Frankenstein"". That's a good book. - Yeah, better than the movie. - You thought so, too? Yeah. - Can I see it? - Yeah. ""He sprung from the cabin window ""upon the ice raft, which lay close to the vessel. ""He was soon borne away by the waves, ""and lost in darkness... and distance. "" Hey, that's the end! Don't give away the ending. ""The monster... Frankenstein. "" ""Rashomon"". What's this about? Pearline? You can borrow that. You just gotta promise that when you read it, you come tell me what you think. OK, I will. Is it true you got no friends, then? No. My best friend's right over there. - You wanna meet my best friend? - I don't see anybody. He's there in that ice cream truck. What do you think, I'm a chump? I'm not going there. I hardly know you. Whatever. Well, all right. Pearline, where are you going? I'm going to get ice cream. I'm coming right back. This is my best friend, Raymond. Raymond, this is... - Pearline, right? - Yeah. My best friend. Well, OK. Thanks. Chocolate's my favourite. Yeah. Me, too. - What language is he talking? - French. - He only speaks French. - Do you understand French? No. I never understand a word he says. - And that's your best friend? - Yeah. - Bears? - Yes! Bravo! - What's he talking about? - Bears, I guess. I gotta go. I got some business to take care of. For the ice cream. That book, read it and tell me what you think, OK? - OK. - OK. Take it easy, Raymond. That fucking thing loaded? - Yeah, OK. - Come on, let's do it. Ready? That could be him right there. Should I shoot him? No, that ain't him. Vargo said it was a black guy. So, what's he? What are you, Puerto Rican? - I think he's an Indian. - What the hell are you? Cayuga. Cayuga? What the fuck is Cayuga? Puerto Rican, indian, nigger... same thing. We should waste him to be sure. It ain't authorised, so let's go. I wanna get the right guy. - Stupid fucking white man. - What? I said stupid fucking white man. You red nigger-looking Sitting Bullshit motherfucker! Sam, you're losing control. Let's get out of here. Cayuga, my ass! You better learn to keep your fucking mouth shut, or I'll blow your fucking brains out myself. You dumb fuck! Hey, what the heck is going on, fellas? What? What? Ah, shit! I don't think that's him. - How the hell do you know? - It doesn't feel right. Now he's got his own wings, he can fly with his pigeons. Vargo said, if he even looks like him, shoot him, right? I know. Let's go. I gotta take care of something for Sonny. Fuck. I knew that was gonna be you. You gonna kill me? You might as well kill me. I'm your retainer. I follow a code. I've always given you my respect. That's why you've got that big fucking gun to my head? Forgive me. I don't mean you no disrespect. - How the fuck did you find me? - Called me for a meeting. Yeah. Everything seems to be changing all around us. You can say that again. When you did that guy the other night, was a girl there? I wasn't instructed to eliminate her. I know, it's just that... things have gotten all complicated now. They're gonna whack you, Ghost Dog. If they don't find you, they're gonna whack me instead. - Probably whack me anyways. - Ray Vargo? The whole family's looking for you. - The underboss, Valerio, too? - Of course. He pulls all the... Hey... How the fuck do you know so much about our organisation? - Who was the girl? - She's... Forget about her, I can't talk about that. I'm warning you that they're gonna kill you. - Maybe me, too. - Better me than you, Louie. Well... Right now, I'd have to agree with that. Hey, Louie! Sorry I'm late... and I'm real sorry about this. Jesus Christ! You just shot Morini. Valerio's fucking brother-in-law! - He was gonna shoot you. - What? See if he's dead. I don't think he's getting any older. Roll him over. Now you really better shoot me. There's no way I'm gonna explain this. Fuckin' Morini! OK, shoot me. Go ahead, kill me now. I'm your retainer. It's against the code of the samurai. If you're my retainer, whatever that is, then do what I tell you! Oww! - What did you that for? - You told me to. I don't mean you no disrespect. Now you've got an excuse. Tell them I attacked you both. You better watch your back, Ghost Dog! Like you said, everything seems to be changing around us. Nothing makes sense any more. I'm gonna take your knight. Talking about ice cream? It's amazing. How the hell is he gonna get it down from here? Ah... I gotta go. I got business to take care of. The sun's coming down. Yeah. There is something you could do for me. Yeah. 'And now, my newest invention. ' 'I can turn diamonds... into jelly beans! 'But do you think I'm happy? 'No! I'm frustrated, frustrated, frustrated, frustrated! 'You ask why? Felix the Cat and his bag of tricks. - 'It's magic!' - 'I'll make a canoe. ' 'Magic and more magic!' I thought we discussed this yesterday. All I want is my money. There's people here. We can discuss this another time. Every time I have to come get my rent. It's every three months. 'I'll try to get the bag like this!' 'It tickles!' Sanchez, I've got bigger problems. I'll clear it up tomorrow. Pay me that money or I'll call the City Marshal. Three months rent! What kind of operation are you guys running here anyway? What? What? I don't think the boss buys your story, either. Morini was family. He was also my brother-in-law. Sonny, I'm sad about what happened, but I got shot! You think I'm making this up? I don't know what I fucking believe! Joe, Snake. Go to the garage, get some cars. First thing tomorrow, take Mr Vargo to his castle in the woods. - Right now? - No, next fucking week! Let's go! Passenger pigeon! Somebody grab the goddamn thing! - Grab him, Vinny. - Yeah. I got him. Here you go. Get out with that flying rat. Just get the message off him. Send him home, Vinny. It says, ""If a samurai's head were to be suddenly cut off, ""he should still be able to perform one more action... ""with certainty. "" What the fuck is that supposed to mean? It's poetry. The poetry of war. Excuse me, excuse me! Step into the alley, please! OK! Plan B. Hello, I'm Bob Solo. I'm with West Side Realty. I have an appointment with Mr Vargo. How did you get in the gate, Mr Solo? Mr Valerio gave me the code. It's very important. I may have a buyer for the estate. Go inside, Sammy. Check this out. I'll stay here with our Mr Solo. Mind if I stretch my legs? No, you stay in the car, Mr Solo. OK. Why don't I give you my card? Jeez... You sonofa... Sonofabitch! Jesus, it's the fucking birdman! Ah, Jesus... I've been expecting you. It's you again. You borrowed my book. Goddammit! You shot me in the same place as last time. I'm your retainer. I don't mean you no disrespect. Besides, I don't want to put too many holes in you. Where's Sonny Valerio, Louie? I'll see you later, Louie. Vinny? Vinny? I'm in here, Louie. Wow! That's a big bear you killed there. Yep. The fucker weighs about 300 pounds. Yeah. It's funny. I didn't even know it was bear-hunting season. What are you, a game warden? Some kinda Fed? No, no. I'm just asking, you know, just asking. Well, I'll tell ya. There aren't too many of these big black fuckers left here. So when you get a clear shot at it, you sure as hell take it. That's why you shoot 'em... .. 'cause there're not that many left? I don't think I understand your question. You know, there ain't that many coloured people here, neither. You oughta get back in your car and go about your own business. Yeah... maybe you're right. Jesus Christ, you fucking hit my knee! You know, in ancient cultures... bears were considered equal with men. This ain't no ancient culture here, mister. Sometimes it is. 'Aaaahh... ' You know, Louie... There's one good thing about this Ghost Dog guy. What's that, Vin? He's sending us out in the old way. Like real fucking gangsters. Hang on, Vin. You're gonna make it. Just hang in there. Oh, Christ! Fucking five-o. Remain inside the vehicle. When you're in the city, you never see a cop, but here, they're like the fucking Gestapo! Like we're in some fucking foreign country! My friend has to get to a hospital. What happened to your arm? I'm fine, it's my friend here. License and registration, please. We don't have time! Don't push me, mister! Remain inside the vehicle. Oh, yeah... This is terrific. What's the situation here, sir? Let's get the fuck out of here, Louie! Jesus, Vin! You just iced a woman, you know that? You know what you are, Louie? You're a fucking male chauvinist pig. What do you mean, I'm a male chauvinist pig? - You just shot a broad! - A cop! I just shot a cop. They wanna be equal... I made her equal. Vin? Hey, Vin! You with me over there? Oh, no. No... Hey, Raymond. I ain't seen you in a while, man. That little girl, Pearline? She probably wanted to give me that book back. I wonder what she thought about it. Hey, man... It's a little big, but one of those Haitian tailors can cut up, fit it for you. Yeah, that's for you. Hi, guys! My fucking Jaguar! Shit! Fuck! You got a phone? Oh, man. Shit! Shit! What the fuck? Ghost Dog. Power and equality. Always see everything, my brother. Raymond! Raymond, man. Hey. You look worried. Don't worry, man. It's OK. It's all right. I need to get inside the truck, all right? Let me get in the truck. Turn around, man. Turn around, turn around. No, no... No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Here, I wanna give you this. I don't want you to worry, Raymond. Don't you worry about nothing. Everything happens for a reason. You know that guy who was here, with his arm in a sling? Yeah... I know that guy. He's name's Louie. I'm his retainer. See, once, a long time ago, he helped me out. You motherfucker! What's going on? What's the problem here? 'And I owed him for that. 'See, a samurai must ALWAYS stay loyal to his boss. 'No matter what happens. ' Anyway, me and him, we're from different ancient tribes. And now, we're both almost extinct. Sometimes... you gotta stick with the ancient ways. The old-school ways. I know you understand me. I know you understand me. Hello? Anyone home in there? No, but thank you. I'm not really hungry. Ghost Dog, I brought your book back. I finished it a few days ago, but I didn't see you. What did you think? I liked all six different stories. Ancient Japan was a pretty weird place. But I especially liked the first story. It's one story, but each person sees a totally different story. - That was really good. - ""Yabu No Naka"". That's my favourite, too. Well, thank you for returning it, and thank you for your comments. - Will you do me a favour? - What? Take this book... and you read it some time. You don't gotta read it right away. OK. Is it good? Yeah, well... I liked it a lot. It's not exactly a story, it's kind of a... Ghost Dog! You should go home now. What is this, Louie? ""High Noon""? This is the final shoot-out scene? I guess it is. Yeah... Well, it's very dramatic. It's very dramatic... and I understand. You have to avenge the death of your bosses, right? Well, OK, then. Stay back! Raymond! Stay back. Now you're gonna be the boss of your own clan, right, Louie? 'Cause... there ain't nobody else left... Ain't that right, Louie? No, not exactly, Ghost Dog. Stay there! It's like you said, better you than me, right? Nothing makes any sense any more. It's OK, Louie. I've seen everything I need to see. Do me one favour, though. One favour. What do you want me to do? You take this book... and read it some time. Then, later on... you can tell me what you think. Yeah... sure. Let's go! Let's get out of here! This is my book. No, Miss Vargo, I got it from the guy, from Ghost Dog! Can we get out of here? It takes place in ancient Japan. You should read it. We can go now. Pearline, you're in the way, honey. Why don't you go in the other room to read your book, darling? Synchronization by ShooCat",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Ghost_Dog_The_Way_of_the_Samurai-165798

Why does she hate me, Thomas? She doesn't. Yes, she does. You can never tell with women, George. They're different.

Bit of work, you know. What do you do now? Whatever comes up. Yeah, but this is a knocking shop. Leave it out, George. So, where is he? Mortwell? He's not around. Well, he must be somewhere. Better ask Dudley, George. Through there? Expecting me? Knew I was out? I suspected it, George. So, where is he? Where's who? Mortwell. He's away, George. South of France. He owes me, Dudley. He said he'd look after me. He said a lot of things, George. Next time you see him, give him that! Oi, George, George. Come on. Look, we need a driver. I'm a driver. Do you know what a bleeper is? I can't understand it, how's that little thing it's supposed to go bleep wherever I am? Well, it bounces off the Post Office tower, George. Miracle of modern technology. Yeah, but it hasn't got an aerial or nothing. Ah, it doesn't need one. Look, I'll show you, right? What's that? Is that going? No, no, that's a tester to see it's making a noise. Don't muck about with it, for Christ sake. You've been pulling that bleeding knob. I bet you've buggered it. What do you think? What do you do, melt it down and eat it? No, they're ornamental, George. Ornamental spaghetti? Aye. I reckon it'll go a bomb. Where did you get it? Contacts, George. Can't find plastic spaghetti just anywhere. Nah. I don't suppose too many people make it, do they? Aye. Well, the Japanese cornered the market. You fancy a fiberglass fruit flan? Or a polystyrene tutti-frutti? Fancy a cup of tea? What's it made of?

I don't know you, do I? Pretend you fucking well do. Not the back, the front. So, where did they get you from? Under a cabbage leaf. I have to work these places. The bar boy turns a blind eye but the manager doesn't. Are you gonna tell me where you wanna go? The Lambert. Sorry. Didn't they tell you that? You're meant to be my date not my minicab driver. What does your date do? He looks after me, you dingbat. He's meant to want to see me. And what if he don't? He pretends. How do you pretend? Christ, who sent you? Does it matter? You're the tom, darlin'. Just shut up and drive, would you? Oh, can I have a large Bloody Mary? I'm sitting here, all right? Here, did you hear me?

Road House 2: Last Call (2006) - full transcript,"While he's deep undercover in New York, DEA agent Shane Tanner, the son of a legendary cooler named Dalton, learns that his uncle Nate Tanner got beat up by a group of men because he doesn't want to sell the Black Pelican, his bar in Tyree, Louisiana. Shane takes off for Louisiana to find out who attacked Nate. Shane decides to stay in Nate's house for the time being, and run the Black Pelican in Nate's absence, much to the dismay of former Black Pelican cooler Bill ""Wild Bill"" Decarie. Wild Bill wants to buy the Black Pelican since it's located in a prime location for running drugs. The Black Pelican is close to the border, it's between Florida and Texas, and it's in an area where drugs can be smuggled pretty much undetected. But Shane doesn't want to sell, and damages the numerous thugs that Bill sends his way. Also, Dalton was murdered years ago, and Shane still wonders who killed Dalton. When Shane was a rookie state trooper in Tyree, Shane had come home from work one night, and found Dalton fatally shot. After that, Shane left town and became a DEA agent. Now, Wild Bill's boss, Miami crime syndicate kingpin Victor Crost, decides that it's time to handle matters personally, because Wild Bill's men are not doing a good job of it. Shane is soon faced with impossible odds and a low number of staff members at the Black Pelican. To rid Louisiana of Victor, Wild Bill, and their organization, Shane teams up with local school teacher Beau Hampton, who is a regular at the Black Pelican.","Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I'm not selling. Tell your boss. Did you get all that? Last call! Black Pelican. Yeah. Boss! You got a phone call. Thank you. Hello. Nate, I don't know if you know this, but we got a big problem here. What are we talking about? Some of the boys working for you might not be as loyal as you think. Who are we talking about? I'll tell you everything, but not on the phone. Meet me at the Drift-ln Pier in 30 minutes. -What's up? -Hey. Ladies. Are you dealing? -DEA! -Stay where you are. -Hands where I can see them! -Let me see your hands. Let's go. All right, up, let's go. -Haul them out of here. -Come here. I got this one. You know, I kind of like this gig. Kind of turns me on. I think you should take off these cuffs. If I take off these cuffs... ...how do I know you're not gonna run? You should think about this for a second career. -You're pretty good at it. -Why, thank you. You know, I'd love to stay and play... ...but I got a job to do. Shane, where are you going? You really think all this cloak-and-dagger stuff is necessary? -I should've known. -It's your last chance. Sell, or I'll gladly kill you right now. Go to hell. You still can't win an honest fight. Honest fight? There ain't no such thing. I promised you that I was gonna take everything you had... ...when you kicked me out. So you could deal your filthy drugs. Crawling on the ground and you're still on your high horse. Standing there with a gun like a tough guy... ...you're still a pathetic punk. Later, Nate. It sucked knowing you. Somebody send for my Feds. Tanner. Shit. I put you undercover for four months... ...and all you give me is Freddie fucking Rogers? Where's the big one you keep promising me? Hold on. Yeah? -Shane Tanner? -Yes. This is Deputy Garland Hendricks of Tyree Parish Sheriff's Department. -Are you Nate Tanner's next of kin? -Yeah, he's my uncle. Well, I sure am sorry to have to tell you this... ...but we found him earlier this evening in pretty bad shape. -What happened? -Well... ...Iooks like somebody beat the hell out of him. -What hospital? -Shumpert. Down here in Tyree, Louisiana. -Where are you going, Tanner? -I got a lead on that big one. -What do you got? -Can't say just yet? If you don't tell me, you can't go. Well, then consider me on temporary leave. -Shane, where are you going? -Louisiana. What's in Louisiana? My uncle's in the hospital. I gotta get down there. -I'll come with you. -No, I'll be fine. -Want me to take you to the airport? -I don't fly. Too dangerous. Don't tell that prick where I'm going. When you question Freddie... ...see if he knows anything about my father's death. -Think he had something to do with it? -No, but always ask. Hey, Luthor. I'm sorry to hear about Nate. It's a shame. My attorney will be by in a couple of days with some paperwork. I'm sure Nate's ready to sell by now. Sure thing, Bill. -Nice boots, dude. -How'd you like them up your ass? Stupid whore! Hey, Nate made it clear Bill and those assholes aren't supposed to be in here. Look what happened to him. Well, Nate's still the boss. -What do you want? -Thought you could use a hand. I'm fine. -Here, let me help. -Hey! Just wanna help. Could you hand me one of those lug nuts? Thanks. Another one. Hey, knight in shining armour... ...am I supposed to know you from somewhere? I don't think so. I don't live around here. Yeah, no kidding. Look out! Asshole! -Who was that? -You don't wanna know. Well... ...I'm done. Get to a gas station. The tire's a little low, it needs air, all right? -Where are you headed? -Shumpert Hospital. If you take this road as far as it goes... -...then take up the old cemetery-- -I know. I thought you said you weren't from around here. I used to be. -So the boss is happy? -Oh, yes. I'm very happy. -I meant Mr. Crost. -Mr. Crost is an overseer. This is my parish. An overseer, huh? That's why he gets 80 percent and you get 20. Not for long. Now, get out of my face, you're pissing me off. This is for Ducky and his brothers, tonight at last call. Don't bother me with the details. You must be Nate's nephew. I'm Deputy Hendricks. I spoke to you on the phone. Shane Tanner. -So how is he doing? -The doctor said he's stabilized. -They're gonna move him out of lC. -Well, that's good. That's-- That's real good. -You guys find who did it yet? -Well, we're looking into it. I figure it's just a case of wrong place, wrong time. Wrong place, wrong time, huh? Yeah, that's-- That's what I figure. That happen a lot around here? Wrong place, wrong time? Look, son, you're upset, I understand that. But you shouldn't have come all the way down here. There's nothing you can do. Is that right? Someone's gotta run the Pelican until my uncle's back on his feet. And if you guys ain't gonna find out who did it, I will. All right, punch it now. Hit it hard. Come on. Hit it again. Hands up. Get your hands up, Shane. Punch him. Step back, step back. Side kick. There you go. Hit that bag. Come on, hit that bag hard, boy. Come on. I believe in you, boy. Come on. Hey. Hey. You must be hungry, huh? Yeah? Okay, K.P., that's it for tonight. Let's wind it up, okay? Last call! Last call for alcohol! Hey! You look familiar. Do I know you? Yeah, I run this joint now. No shit. You're Nate's nephew. I heard all about you. -You're Dalton's kid, right? -Yes. -You as tough as your daddy was? -Opinions vary. Don't you know who the fuck I am? Fucking name is Mr. Marcus. Stepping on my shoe, are you crazy? Name is Mr. Marcus, you understand? Repeat it, ""Mr. Fucking Marcus."" That's Marcus Reynolds. He's bad news. Just for that, wash my fucking car and pay my tab, bitch. Repeat after me. What's my name? -Marcus. -What? What? Mr. Marcus. You boys having fun? Hold my glasses. Who the hell are you? Stick your pretty ass somewhere else. I'm afraid I can't do that. Yeah, he can't do that. Let me show him what he can do. Let's get these guys out of here. Keep this shit out of my club. Holy shit. You're Dalton's kid. Heard all about you. Thought you'd be bigger. So, what happened in there? You talk to the cops yet? Yeah, this deputy said it was some random thing. Random my ass. Wild Bill's been making runs at buying this place for a while now. Every time I ask Nate about it, he just clams up. I don't think those two like each other very much. -Who's this Wild Bill? -He's an ex-cooler. He used to work for your uncle. He is one big, bad dude. -Why does he want the Pelican? -Location, location, location. See, the Pelican happens to occupy some prime-ass real estate... ...when it comes to the exciting world of drug running. You're not too far from the border, directly between Texas and Florida. You can transport through the swamp virtually undetected. You. You got 10 seconds to walk out of here before I throw you out. -Luthor, do you know who this guy is? -I don't give a shit who he is. This is Nate's nephew. This is Shane Tanner. Excuse me a second, boys. Oh, before everyone leaves tonight, l'd like to have a little chat with the staff. This is a nice surprise. I didn't get a chance to thank you for helping me out. So thanks. -Can I buy you a drink? -I don't drink. I just wanted say thank you. -You're leaving already? -I'm sure I'll see you around. Hey! I didn't get your name. Yo, chief, the fine pair of jeans you were talking to left this at the bar. She'll come back for it. As you probably all know by now, I'm Nate's nephew, Shane. I'll be looking after the club for a while and looking after it properly. Luthor, guys were dealing shit inside. Nate didn't allow it, I won't either. We sell booze in here, not drugs. Is that clear? Over the years, Nate told me who he trusted, who had his back. Now I need to know who's got mine. You ever run a club before? I know how my uncle ran a club, and how my father ran a club. Three rules were lived by in the Pelican. Rule number one:. Never underestimate anyone or any situation. Rule number two:. Take it outside. Someone gives you trouble inside, escort them out. -Rule number three-- -Be nice... ...until it's time to not be nice. You need to know... ...those guys you kicked out of here earlier... ...work for Wild Bill. I keep hearing about this Wild Bill. You think he had anything to do with my uncle winding up in the hospital? Wild Bill's got his hands in just about everything that goes on in this town. Great. Can't wait to meet him. A new owner? Who the fuck--? Look, I don't know. Some guy. Somebody bought the Black Pelican out from under my nose? -Boss, phone. -Are you interrupting me? -It's Miami. -I'll take it inside. Hello. When you started working for me, Bill, you wanted money... ...power and influence in that quaint little parish of yours. -You got that now. You know why? -Because we don't have problems. The Duffy Brothers have been clients of ours for a long time. It is a problem when they don't get their merchandise. It doesn't make me feel confident you can handle the De Marco deal. I can handle it. Securing Antoine De Marco and his connections... ...will finally legitimize us as a premier operation in Louisiana. You better be able to handle it. -ls everything okay, baby? -Yeah, it's good. We need the Pelican. So I want you all to get on the horn with the lawyers... ...and make that place mine, do you hear me? Well, Mr. Tanner. A pleasure. How's that hammer hanging? My name is Embry Davis. I've been authorized by Mr. William Decarie... ...to offer you 400,000 dollars cash to take this bar off your hands. It's not even worth half that. Mr. Decarie is being very generous with this offer. Well, tell him I said thank you, but it's not for sale. Son, I don't think you understand the subtleties of all this. Problem, boss? Something wrong with you, boy? You know why they call me the robot? Because I'm so automatic at kicking your ass. -You retarded? -Learning impaired. I think what my friend is trying to say is, take a walk. Yeah, well.... Good day, girls. -Thanks. -Want you to know we got your back. -How's everything going today? -It's all right. Hendricks. -That's good. -There you go. -Thank you, sir. -Keep the change. -Any leads? -No. Did you ask Marcus Reynolds where he was the night Nate got jumped? We had to let Reynolds go. Sheriff said there wasn't enough evidence. I found two ounces of crystal on his person. -Well, his lawyers said it was planted. -Planted? That's bullshit, and you know it. We do what we can around here, but there's only three of us and it's.... Well, it's complicated. You wanna go after Wild Bill Decarie and his boys... ...you're gonna need some major firepower. Marcus Reynolds works for Wild Bill? We all do. Monyhan, it's Tanner. I need a favor. Call me back as soon as you can. Cocktail? Get that ass up. -Here you go. -Fucking always clears the mind. Nice work there, boss. Nice work. So Dalton's kid is in town to save the day, huh? Yep. -But he won't sell? -Won't budge. We got two buyers coming in from Watkins Parish this weekend... ...plus we got the De Marco deal next week. Now, I wanna be able to celebrate in Wild Bill's Black Pelican. -My new center of operations. -I hear you, boss. They thought Dalton was a legend. Wait till they get ahold of me. Shane Tanner, huh? It's a long time. It's a pity what happened to his father. If he don't sell, I'm gonna fucking squash him. I'll take care-- Well, hello, my little rose petal. Embry Davis is the name. Nice backstroke, boss. Goodbye, ladies. Rack them up! Yeah? It's rude to answer someone else's phone. But I thought you'd call sooner or later. Just waiting by the phone, huh? Is it okay if I call you right back? I'm-- I'm out running errands. Or l-- I could stop by later... ...and drop off your phone. I'm kind of busy right now. I'm running errands myself. Are you sure? It won't take long. Half hour tops. All right, I guess it's the least I can do for your changing my tire. Great. Oh, hey, baby. Good morning. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to break into someone else's house? Well, the door was open. -Are you okay? -No. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Nice move. You know, I could've blew your head off. I almost blew yours off. I figured I'd come over here and get my phone... ...and see if I could take you out for coffee. -You could've called. -Didn't have my phone. -Use a pay phone. -Didn't have your number. -How'd you know where I was staying? -Chubby told me. Here's your phone. You know... ...I finally got you in my bedroom, and I still don't know your name. That sounds like a country song. I finally got you in my bed room And I still don't know your name Beau. My name is Beau. Hurry up. I'll get you that cup of coffee. -Where did you learn to kick like that? -Girl Scouts. Girls Scouts are pretty tough around here, huh? It does wonders for the cookie sales. If you don't buy any, we kick your ass. Are you a cop? That was a Glock you were pointing at me. I'm a federal agent. Drug enforcement. But you gotta keep that to yourself, okay? Surprised you haven't been down here sooner. This place is a hotbed for drug activity. What's the sheriff doing about it? Trust me, local law enforcement... ...doesn't always have the people's interest at heart. Friend of yours? She's in the Brownies. -Girl Scouts hate Brownies. -Hi, Ms. Hampton. -Hey, Betsy, how was your summer? -lt was good. -I get to see you soon, huh? -Yeah. Can't wait for school to start. Go tell your mom I say, ""Hey."" -Okay. Bye. -Bye. -School teacher? -Elementary. She's one of my best students. I gotta take this. Hey. -Where the hell are you? -I'm down in Louisiana. Have you heard of a dealer named Bill Decarie? Afraid not. What's up? Could you check him out for me? Sure thing, buddy. Soon as I get done here. -Thanks, man. -Hey, gotta run. Stay cool. Jesus. I'll call you later. Are you sure you don't need help? Nate used to talk about you all the time. What a tough little fucker you were. And then your daddy got killed... ...and you split town. So listen, your.... Your latest offer was very persuasive. I think Nate would be more than happy with the cash... ...so why don't you stop by the bar and we will-- We'll work something out. Perfect. I got some business associates coming into town this weekend. How about I bring them by the bar? -We'll kill two birds with one stone. -Saturday night it is. Boys, we've been expecting you. Where is the pretty boy? Shane Tanner, in the flesh. I thought you'd be bigger. I'll make this easy. I'll sell for 400 grand... ...plus whatever it takes to refurnish Nate's place. So send over the paperwork, and I'll sign whatever you want. And in the meantime, we reserved our best table upstairs... ...for you and your friends. It's a mighty kind offer. But I think I'd like something a little more private. Hey, guys. You, get out of here. Get, get! -Change of plan. -Okay. Morales, go watch that door over there. Everybody ready? All right, show him the goods. See what you got. Hold on. -Setup! -Shit. We have been made! Move, move, move! Everybody get down, he's got a gun! DEA. Show me your hands! I got it. Cover them. Freeze! Get down! Get down! Get-- Get down! -Move this boat or I'll kill you! -Put it out! Put it out! Move it! Move it! Move this thing or I'll kill her! Move it! And technically the sheriff is right. It does fall under his jurisdiction. He should have been told. Yeah. Listen, I gotta get back tonight. You take care of yourself. Not only do you have that slick fucker pissed at you, but the way I hear it... ...Captain Stenton back in New York considers you AWOL. I forgot all about him. Look, Shane... ...I know coming back down here must be eating you up inside. Just make sure you cover your ass. Besides, with the message we sent tonight... ...he'd be crazy to come anywhere near here. Okay. More trouble in Tyree Parish. What a fucking surprise. I've got the De Marco meeting Saturday night. Never send in a minor leaguer... ...to pitch game seven of the World Series. -Stone, get the plane ready. -You got it. Well, I just lost two more bouncers. Said they'd rather quit than end up dead. Bill wouldn't come back here, right? The place was swarming with federal agents and shit. He'll stay away, right? We're closing the Pelican down for a while until things cool off. Well, I'll let the boys go home, get some sleep. We'll come back tomorrow, clean the place up. Thanks. I'll stop by and lend a hand. You can feel it in the air, boss. -There's some heavy shit going down. -Yeah. No kidding. Watch out, man. Wild Bill's got a lot of soldiers. Oh, God, I hate this fucking shithole. How charming. You live in a fucking swamp, you know that, Bill? Hey, the swamp is a-- Hey, do not play with that. -You giving my men orders? -No. I just expect a little respect. Respect? The DEA and the FBl are all over J.B. Watkins... ...and you want my respect? You need to earn it. Look at you. You're a wild dog playing at middle management. I want the Dalton kid and any of his associates dead. And I want it over in two days... ...so we can seal De Marco... ...and I can get home for the Marlins game. Nate Tanner? Thanks. Hey. Hey, hey! What are you doing here? What the hell am I doing here? You got jumped by Bill Decarie and his boys. Luthor set me up. -I'll take care of him. -Yeah. I'll come with you. I'm tired of being in here. I gotta get out of here. Maybe not just yet. I.... Listen, don't worry about Luthor. He's nothing, meaningless. But don't underestimate Wild Bill. Uncle Nate, I'm sorry, but I had to close down the Pelican. Things got a little out of control. Listen, don't be too hard on yourself, okay? That place is destined for trouble. The location-- Yeah, location, location, location. Shit. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Been a long time. Been a long time. Listen, you gotta promise me something. You gotta promise me that you'll be careful down here. It is not like the old days. You can't settle things with your fists and sweat anymore. This millennium, they shoot first, ask questions later. You don't know who to trust, nobody's straight... ...or true anymore. Oh, man. You know, your dad got one thing wrong. Pain does hurt. You stay away from that pretty boy over at the Pelican tonight... ...unless you wanna get yourself killed. -Yeah? -It's Beau. Oh, hey. So you think you could take a lady on a proper date tonight? Well, I'm here at the hospital right now. And I'm supposed to go over to the Pelican tonight and help clean up. -Well, you have to eat, right? -Yeah. What would your uncle say if you said no to a pretty woman... ...after she begged you for a date? -You're right. I'll pick you up at (. -Make it 7. Well, I hope she has a nice ass. I thought you were sleeping. I'll sleep when I'm dead. Go have some fun. I'll be all right in a couple days. We'll take care of all this. Who do you trust? I'll catch you later. You look wonderful. -Thank you. -So shall we? So how come you don't have a boyfriend? Who says I don't? I haven't found a guy that's safe enough or strong enough, I guess. You see, most guys either have too much testosterone... ...or they're just too passive. Well, I guess that takes me out of the mix. Why is that, too much testosterone? You're too scared to make a move? No, the safe part. You said you needed a guy who's safe enough. That's not me. No. I meant safe enough to give my heart to. See, my father travelled around a lot, so I spent most of my teens with Nate. He was the one who pushed me to go to college, get an education. And when my father died, Nate was the only family I had left. -How'd it happen, your dad? -He was murdered. Oh, my God. I came home from work one night and I found him dead in the living room. He'd been shot. -You know who did it? -I still don't know. I let my father borrow my car that night, he pulled in the driveway... ...he walked in, someone shot him. I figured they must have thought it was me. I'm the one who's supposed to be dead. I gotta get you back. I gotta get to the Pelican. -Help the boys clean up. -Don't go. Let's go back to my place. I really should go over. What would your uncle say if you said no... ...to a passionate young woman? I gotta get going. I'm late. Oh, no, no. Don't you leave me all alone. I can come back. I'm coming with you. Is he.... -Help. -Chubby. Chubby. Luthor. Luthor let them in. -Hello? -It's Tanner. Tanner, where are you? There's a problem. Can you meet me at the Pelican? Yeah. Crost, this is Luthor. Tanner wants me to meet him at the Pelican. All right, we'll be there in 10 minutes. Good. This is for Nate. I was supposed to be at the club. I'm the one who's supposed to be dead, right? Why don't you ask your little bitch? They're going to the girl's house. Once again, you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. We'll take care of Tanner, you go pay his uncle a visit. Then we'll all meet back here for the De Marco meeting. You fuck this up, I'll fuck you up. Let's get out of here. Fuck, I hate this shit. My town. My bird. Tell the boys to get ready. We've got some unfinished business over at the hospital. -Hello? -You better get out of that house. Trouble's coming. -You knew it was gonna happen. -Shane. You asked me out to keep me from the Pelican. -Listen-- -Why'd you do it? Listen to me. Bill just called. -They're on their way here to kill you. -Why would he call you? The same reason he warned me about the Pelican. He's my cousin. Hey, hey. Can I help you? Hey, hey, hey, put that away. I didn't know anyone would get hurt. They wanted you. And as long as you're with me, I thought-- -Girl Scouts? -Army. It paid for my college. You go that way, over here. Goddamn it! Don't worry, ma'am. They were with the insurance company. Stay down. You're not supposed to be out of bed. You're not listening to the nurses. Go check down there. Hey, Marcus. Marcus. You all right, buddy? Hey, you hear me? He's in the hallway. Stab me once, shame on you. Stab me twice... ... not gonna happen. You're a hard man to get ahold of. You have been giving Bill and his boys fits. Are you really that good? Or is he that dumb? And you must be the cousin. Take this pretty little thing out back. -Show Bill how I care about his family. -Get the fuck off me! So that's it? You're just gonna shoot me? I always finish a job. Be nice till it's time not to be nice. Hey, thank you. It's all right now. That's for calling me a backstabber. -You don't remember me, do you? -Remember you? You were a Louisiana state trooper, a rookie. You pulled me over in the interstate. Took me in on marijuana and cocaine possession. Get that bitch up. Get your fucking pants off. You're next, Fidel. The cops seized my house... ...took my Ferrari, my boat. At the time, I thought it was all your fault. I took it personal and wanted revenge. Sorry about your father. That was an unfortunate mistake. I'm gonna get me some of that. Bitch. Bitch! Oh, come on. I ain't finished yet, Mr. Rookie Cop. Bitch, you-- No! Wait, wait. It wasn't me. I didn't pull the trigger. -Who did? -Wild Bill. He was working at the Pelican, but he was also working for me. -So I hired him to kill you. -Where is he? I don't know. Wait! I got a deal going down at Pelican tonight. I'll cut you in, get you some cash. Where is he? All right, all right. Hospital. Beau. Gotta get to Nate. -To the hospital. -Okay. Nurse! We need some help in here! Hey, hey. Sorry, you can't go in right now. Monyhan, how fast can you get here? Hold it right where you are. How the hell are we gonna get past him? We're not. The road's closed for parish business. How many more are gonna die... ...because you won't stand up and do the right thing? This is your town. These are your people. This deal is gonna take us to our next level of expanding our operation. Hey, man! Hey, hey, last call! Last call for alcohol! -Bill. -What do you think about my new bar? -Well, it needs a little work. -Well.... Wait, I thought Mr. Crost was gonna join us. Yeah, well, he.... That's probably him right now. Go check it out. Go on, go on. -Check it out. -He's in there. -He's in. -He's inside. Come on, bitch! I hate cops! Get down! I'm gonna kill you just like I killed your father. God! Get the fuck off of me. -Let see what's your insides look like. -You fucking freak. Never in my wildest dreams... ...did I think I'd get to kill the father, the son, and the holy Nate. I believe in you, boy. Come on. This is for my uncle. And this is for my father. Antoine De Marco and Victor Crost. I'd say this counts as the big one Captain Stenton wanted. Monyhan! I'm gonna have your badge for this. You done gone too damned far. If I were you, I'll be getting my lawyer on the phone. What makes you think I'm gonna need a lawyer? So when are you heading back north? That's assuming I'm heading back north. Are you? -That's a direct question. -I'm a direct girl. Yes, you are. What would your uncle say if you left a pretty young woman all alone? He ain't going nowhere. See, we got a lot of catching up to do. It's been a long, long time. It's good to be home. Go Chubby. -Go Chubby. -Go Chubby. Where are those glasses? -Here they are, boss. -Thank you. -How you doing, Larry? -Good. -Good? -Yeah, I like it here. Tough boss.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Road_House_2_Last_Call-469965
The Wrong Man (1956) - full transcript,"In 1953, an innocent man named Christopher Emanuel ""Manny"" Balestrero is arrested after being mistaken for an armed robber.","This is Alfred Hitchcock speaking. In the past, I have given you many kinds of suspense pictures. But this time, I would like you to see a different one. The difference lies in the fact that this is a true story... ...every word of it. And yet it contains elements that are stranger than all the fiction... ...that has gone into many of the thrillers that I've made before. See you later. Good night. Good night, Mr. Rotunda. Good night, John. - Good night, Manny. - Good night, John. Hiya, Manny. How's the family? Morning, Stan. Fine, thanks. - What'll it be, the usual? - The same. I'll bring the toast over to the table. Thank you. - Oh, Rose, did I wake you? - I was awake. Is something wrong? It's just these teeth. I haven't been awake all the time. They hurt, though, huh? Not much. I think it's the price that hurts more than anything else. The dentist told me what it would cost this afternoon. Yeah? Three hundred dollars for the four wisdom teeth. That's a lot of money, but with prices what they are... ...maybe it's not too unreasonable. He even gave me a little lecture on evolution on the side. It seems the human race is growing smaller jaws... ...and having fewer teeth. But the teeth are ahead of the jaws... ...and so everybody has more teeth than they know what to do with. That's why I have four impacted wisdom teeth. You look just about perfect to me. If evolution can produce you, it's doing pretty good. I don't think we ought to complain about a few impacted teeth. All right, we won't complain about it. How do we pay for it? We've had big doctor bills before this. I know, but I thought... ...we'd come to the end of all that. We borrow money, and for years... ...we pay out on the installment plan. It keeps us broke. What is that, a crossword puzzle? It's a little game I play. I pick tomorrow's winners... ...and I write my bets down here, on the side, see, like this. And then the next day, I figure out how much I've won or lost. Oh, I didn't know you liked horses. It's the arithmetic I like, honey. I guess it's the musician in me. Musicians are always fascinated by mathematics. They can't read, but they can figure. It would be nice if you could win us about $300. In my experience, I always pay for what I get. We won't win any 300, we'll borrow it. Every time we get up, something comes along... ...and knocks us right back down again. That's life, honey. That's the way it is. I think we're pretty lucky, mostly. - Are we? - Sure, we are. We're in love... ...we've got two good, bright boys... ...I've got a job I like. I think we're doing pretty well, except for this toothache. You make everything all right again. - Are we lucky people? - Sure, we are. And the luckiest thing that ever happened to me was finding you. Oh, Manny. Sometimes I'm so frightened, waiting for you to come home at night. I always come home, don't I? We better get some sleep. - Can you sleep now? - I think so. - Will you sit here for a while? - Sure. You know you've got some money saved up? I have? - Well, where? - Your insurance policy. I borrowed against mine, but yours is clear. Do you think there'd be enough? I'd have to ask, but I think there'd be enough for most of it. - Who do you ask? - I'll go down this afternoon and find out. Wonderful. Mother! Mother! Those kids. Yes? Yes, what is it? Will you tell Greg to quit playing the mouth organ while I practice? - Greg? Greg? - Will you tell him? - Gregory? - Yes, Mother? Don't play the harmonica while Robert is playing the piano. But I was playing the same thing. - Was he? - He thinks he was, but... I was! I don't want you playing, even if it is the same. - He hides in the closet and makes noise. - What's all this? Robert was playing the piano. Greg was spoiling his music. - I didn't! - You did! - I was playing the same. - You were not! You know, Bob, it sounded to me... ...that last part, when Greg was playing... ...sounded like he caught the melody. - Try it again, Greg. - I can't do it now. No, you can only do it when I'm playing. Now, be fair, Bob. I know he's trying to annoy you... ...but he did play some Mozart. - I did, I did! - Sure, you did. And you were doing very well till you let him throw you. You got a real gift for it... ...so maybe Greg has too. Wouldn't that be fun, Robert? - Then you could play together. - I did well? - Sure, you did. - Sure, you did. You mustn't let things throw you off. You don't wanna pound the piano and then give up. You were doing very well, except for that. It says here Mozart wrote it when he was 5. So I should be able to play it. I'm 8. I'm 5, so I should be able to write it. Tell you what we'll do. Tonight, we'll take time for music lessons. Bob on the piano... ...and Greg on the harmonica. - Mine first! Each lesson will be 15 minutes, and Greg's... Hello? Hello, Mother. How's Pop? Today? I guess I could, but I've got an errand to do first. It couldn't be a very long visit. And I'd have to leave early. I promised the boys I'd give them music lessons... ...before I go to work tonight. Look, suppose I get there about 3:30 and leave about 4:00? Goodbye, Mother. Mother says Pop isn't well. She wants me to come by this afternoon. I'll go by the insurance office, then drop in on Pop... ...and come back as soon as I can. - Is January 4th the first date you replied? - That's right. - You still at 634255th Street? - Yes, we are. All right. Will you sign right here, please? - Is that all I have to do? - That's all. - Goodbye, then. Thank you. - Goodbye. Thanks. I wonder if you'd look at this policy for me... ...and tell me how much we can borrow on it. - Rose Balestrero? - Yes. That's my wife. I wonder... Could you wait while I check on something? Yes. Yes, I'll wait. Don't look all at one time. I didn't hear you. I think the man at the window is the one that's been here before. - The man who...? - Yeah, I'm sure of it. Miss James? There's a man at the window... ...and Peggy thinks that he's the one who held you up. Says he wants to find out... ...how much he can get on his wife's policy. I don't dare look. It is the same man. What can we do? Look at him. I'm not looking at him now... ...you look at him. I don't think I can. What am I gonna tell him? I'm not going near that window. Just look at him. I think I'm gonna faint. Ann. It is the same. I'm gonna sit right here. Talk to him about the policy. Tell him he'll probably get the loan... ...but his wife has to come in. Mr. Balestrero. - You are Mr. Balestrero, of course? - Yes. I can fairly quickly give you the amount that can be borrowed. This figure corresponds with the payments your wife has made. I've checked the amount. Yes, I see. The actual loan, of course, has to have the signature of the policyholder. - She'd have to come in? - Yes... ...your wife would have to come into the office. Yes, I see. She can come in. About how long would it take to make the loan? Oh, it'd just be a matter of days. Thank you very much. Glad to have helped you. - Is he gone? - Yeah. - Where's Miss Duffield? - In with Mr. Wendon. There's the reason he didn't do anything. That was the man that robbed you a while back, wasn't it? I'm almost sure. What did you think? - I'm sure... - Miss Duffield see it? - She's gone on in there. - She... She said the way he entered the room was so very strange. He put his hand in his pocket... ...and all he took out was this folded paper. He said he just wanted a loan on his wife's policy. I'll call the home office. Maybe you and Pop can come over Sunday? I hope we can, Manny. It was good of you to come all the way out here today. - Ciao, Ma. - Ciao. I'd appreciate it if you ladies would wait at home. Stay near a telephone and I'll call you within the next couple of hours. All right, let's pick him up. Well, you know Daddy. He said 5:30, and he's always on time. Mom, what time will Dad be home? - 5:30. - Who is it? About 5:30, I think. Who's calling, Robert? It was some man. He didn't say. What time is it? It's 5:25. If he walks up the steps, it'll probably be him. What do you suppose they call him for short? Well, his first name's Christopher. Probably Chris. Hey, Chris. Your name Chris? - You calling me? - Is your name... ...Christopher Emanuel Balestrero? - Yes, it is. We wanna talk. We're police officers. - What about? - Come to the precinct and help us out. I'm just getting home. I'd like to tell my wife where I'm going. Oh, you'd better come along and tell her later. - Where is it? - 110th Precinct. - Won't take long? - Shouldn't take long. I'd like to tell my wife. It's all right, Chris. Just a routine matter. Come down to the precinct, we'll tell you about it. Found this man outside a liquor store. Saw this man take this without paying for it. Sit down, Chris. - Here? - Fine. Now... ...of course you're wondering why you're here, Mr. Balestrero. - Yes, I am. - I'll tell you the whole thing. There's been a number of holdups in this area... ...all pulled off by one man. People have come forward with descriptions of the man. It's been brought to our attention that you fit the description. - I fit the description? - That's right. - Of the holdup man? - Yep. Well, it's crazy. That's crazy. Sure. From what you say, this whole thing's a big mistake. Why are you keeping me? Everything has to be done according with certain procedure, you see. People bring accusations. All right, we look into the matter. - See if there's anything to it. - I'm completely innocent. We can't take anybody's word for that, you know. We have to clear you before you can go. - How do you clear me? - It's purely a routine matter. But I'll tell you something. It's nothing for an innocent man to worry about. It's the fella that's done something wrong that has to worry. - Well, there's one thing. - Yes. I've never been late without calling... ...and I'm always on time. - That'll be taken care of. Now, there's one thing we'd like you to do for us. We'd like you to go and visit a couple of stores... ...if you don't mind that. - Not if it'll help. - It might. It just might. Let's go. What do you do at the Stork Club? Play in the band. I'm a bass player. I suppose you have some pretty high old times there. - What do you mean? - Oh, women, drinks... ...dancing, that sort of thing. - I don't drink. - No? - Of course, I don't dance at the club... ...I just play in the band. - Is this the one? - Yeah, this is it. You familiar with this neighborhood? Yeah. I've been around here. Ever been in this store? No. The liquor store? No. Now, if you'll just walk into this liquor store... ...walk to the back of the store, turn around and come back here. - In...? - Walk in... ...walk to the back of the store, turn around and come out again. - Won't that look funny? - Not at all. You're just helping us out. The fella in the store is expecting you. I don't say anything? Well, you can if you want to. It isn't necessary. Was that all right? Get into the car. - Lenny's? - Yeah, that's right. Your wife ever go to the Stork Club? No. No, we have two children, even if we didn't. - Even if you didn't? - Costs money. What costs so much, admission? No, there's no admission price... ...but the people who go there are well-to-do. They wear expensive clothes. Everything you order is expensive. Oh, but you had lots of money at times. No, I never have. I'd like you to do the same thing again. - In the store? - Yeah, they're expecting you. Just walk in. Same routine. Wait a minute. - Are you from the 110th Precinct? - Yes, sir. - Can I do anything for you? - No, no. The police sent him over. - Do you recognize him? - Well... That's right, you weren't here Christmas Eve. Well, I was here when the fella came in in November, though. You want him to walk up and down again? Yeah. Would you do that again, walk back with your hat off? Well? Gee, I don't know. Okay, you can go. - What was...? - Did you get your change? No. Say... I'll give you a ring. Right, sir. Okay, next one. It's been over an hour since I called last time, Mother... ...and he still hasn't come home. There must have been an accident. - Mother! Father! - Be quiet! Mother, come now! Will you be quiet? I'm on the phone. No, it's just the boys. Yes, I called the hospitals... ...but they didn't have anybody answering his description. Well, this is unlike Manny. If he couldn't make it home for dinner, he'd call. I wouldn't worry about Manny, Rose. I used to worry sometimes... ...but that's just because he's so steady you never expect him to be late. Well, we wanna ask you... ...have you ever been in the offices of the Associated Life of New York... ...in the Victor Moore Arcade building? I was there this afternoon. Why did you go there? I wanted to find out how much I could borrow... ...on my wife's insurance policy. She's gotta have a lot of work done on her teeth... ...and the dentist said it was gonna be $300. I wanted to find out how much I could borrow. Have you ever been in that office before? Yes. Yes, we've got four policies there... ...my wife and I and the two boys. We've each got one. There was a strike some time ago. The collectors were on strike, and I went into the office to pay the premiums. - It was a long time ago. - How long? Oh, about a year. It's a year since you've been in that office? - I was there this afternoon. - But before... ...it was a year. - That's right. Today, you went to ask about a loan? - Yeah. - You need money, then? Yes, I told you, for the dentist. What do you make a week at the Stork Club? - Eighty-five. - That's the take-home pay? - Yes. - You play the horses? Play? Well, I have, but not very often. How often? - Three or four times. - Not more? I don't think so. You go to the track regularly? A friend of mine from the Stork Club goes on his day off... ...I've been a few times with him. - You ever borrow any money? - Yes, I have. - When was the last time? Last summer, I... I borrowed $50 from the Homewood Finance Company. - We were going on a vacation. - Did you pay it back? - Yes. - Was it difficult to pay back? I guess so. It's always hard to pay back. How much do you owe? - You mean right now? - Yeah, now. Oh, there's not much right now. - There's a few bills. - How much? - Oh, $45. - Maybe 100? - No, it couldn't be that much. - Less than 100? It's less than 50, I'm sure. Probably less than 40. Maybe less than 30. I don't know. - Hard to say when I'm not... - When you're not what? Am I being accused of something? Who says I'm a holdup man or look like one? What holdup are you talking about? - Don't I have a right to know? - Of course you have. I'll tell you. You've been identified by witnesses... ...as the man who held up the offices of Associated Life... ...in the Victor Moore Arcade building. You've been identified as the man who robbed them of $ 71... ...on December 18th and $200 on July 9th last year. Twice they say you were there. The last time... ...less than a month ago. That's not true, is it? No, I've never done anything... - Have you been arrested before? - No, I haven't. Who says I did it? You'll be confronted by the witnesses. If you haven't done it, you have nothing to fear. We wanna give you every break possible. That's the way we do things here. And there's one thing you can do for us... ...that'll make it a lot easier for us and for you. This fella who committed these holdups passed a printed note... ...to the girl at the window. I'll tell you what was in that holdup note. If you would print it out for us, it'll go a long way... ...to show us if you're the same man. Now, you say you're not that man. I certainly am not. Then you certainly won't print the way he does. Will you do it? Yes, I will. Give him a paper and pencil. I'll read the holdup note. - Yes. - Ready? Yes. An innocent man has nothing to fear. Remember that. Oh, that's not the note... ...I'm just telling you. This is the note: ""This is a gun I have pointing at you. Be quiet and you will not be hurt. Give me the money from the cash drawer."" Now, I wanna be entirely fair to you, Manny... ...so I'll tell you right now. There's a rough similarity between your printing and the note. That's right. Would you mind printing that again? - No, sir. - I wanna give you every chance. The note goes: ""This is a gun I have pointing at you. Be quiet and you will not be hurt. Give me the money from the cash drawer."" It's one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen. Look at this. This looks bad for you, Manny. This really looks bad. See that? I think you have a right to know, so I'll tell you. I won't keep anything from you. Here's three pieces of paper. This is the note the holdup man gave the girl at the window. This one is the first you printed at my dictation... ...using the same words. There's a kind of similarity in the printing, but that doesn't mean much. Most people print alike when they use capitals. But it was similar enough, so I asked you to print it again. And when you did, well, something very strange happened. Now, I put down the first copy of the note you made... ...and I show you the second. Read it to me, Manny. Read it out loud. Read exactly what's on the paper here... ...the second copy you made. - This your printing? - Yes, sir. Read it. ""This is a gun I have pointing at you. Be quiet and you will not be hurt. Give me the money from the cash... "" You didn't read the last word. I meant to write ""drawer."" I guess I was in a hurry. I left off the E-R. And that's exactly how the holdup note read. - How do you explain it? - I made a mistake. And so did the holdup man. And it happens to be the same mistake. Find out if the witnesses are here for identification. Well, I'd better hang up. He might be trying to call me now. Okay. I will. Goodbye. Okay, Manny, come on. Now, look carefully at the men in the other room. I want you to count. Please look at the men from right to left. Count them off. And when you come to the one you can identify... ...stop. One, two, three... ...four. You're sure? Absolutely. - Now, Mrs... - Please, don't mention my name. Very well, I won't. Look carefully at the men you see in the other room. Count them off from the right. Observe them carefully. When you come to the one you know, stop. One, two, three... ...four. You're positive? Yes. That will be all. We won't keep you any longer tonight. And thank you. Manny? Positive identification. Here are the two notes. Here's the original, and here's the copy. Well, Manny? - They call you Manny, don't they? - Yes, sir. - You made this copy of the note? - Yes, sir. - With a mistake in it? - Yes, sir. The girls identified you. They saw you in the office, and they saw you here. No use beating around the bush. You held up the office, so say so. But I didn't. You were in that office this afternoon. Yes, I went in to see if I could get a loan on my wife's policy. You better think of another story. Something plausible. But it's the truth! You want to play it that way? What can I...? Don't you see I'm trying to tell the truth? Okay, Manny. With the evidence before us... ...there's nothing to do but lock him up. How can I tell you? What can I do? If you can come up with something else, we'll listen. Come on over here, Manny. Throw your hat and coat on that chair. Give me your right hand. Relax. Wipe your hands with this. Come on, Manny. Take your hat and coat. We're booking this man for robbery, lieutenant. All right, what's his name? Christopher Emanuel Balestrero. - Age? - Thirty-eight. - Married or single? - Married. Address? 402478th Street, Jackson Heights. Use narcotics? No. - What's the charge? - Assault and robbery. Held up the Associated Life of New York. Stole $ 71. All right, search him. Put your coat on the rail, Manny. Six dollars... ...17 cents. What else have you got? It's my wife's life insurance policy. Here's your receipt. You can keep the rosary beads if you wish. Come on, Manny. I never called my wife. That's been taken care of. Give me your tie. Well, naturally, we've been worried. Yes, officer. My name is Conforti. C- o-N-F-o-R-T-I. And I'm his brother-in-law. Oh, I see. Yes, sir. Yes. All right. Thank you. Yeah, goodbye. - Gene? - Just a second. I wanna make sure I got this right. Manny was locked up for the holdup of the Associated Life of New York. Arrested? I knew it was something like that. He was booked and locked up at the 110th Precinct station. Can I see him? Not tonight. He's gonna be arraigned... ...at felony court at 10:00 tomorrow morning. Then he has to spend the night in jail. Yeah. That's what they told me. - Where's felony court? - I don't know. - We'll have to find out. - How could this happen to Manny? Are you sure you heard it right? I wrote down what the man said. He said Manny was booked for a holdup? Yeah. The Associated Life of... - You know, the office down in... - I know what office it is. - I can't imagine. - They'll find out he isn't guilty. Everybody knows he couldn't be guilty. - How can a thing like that happen? - Something sure went wrong. Somebody's gotta tell them. We'll go there tomorrow. Tomorrow. Everybody out. Come on, let's go. Hello, Manny. Come along. Step aside. Step over in front of the microphone. Edward Ray, 97 East 118th Street. What about you? Do you care to tell us about this? Ever been arrested before? - Yep. - June 8, 1942. Arrested for burglary by Detective Bard, 8th Squad... ...sentenced to state's prison, Judge Fell, County Court Manhattan... ...for five to 10 years. - Still on parole? - No. - Step aside. - This way, not that way. Next case. - Queens 1. - Queens 1. Step up this way, please. Stand in front of the microphone. Take your hat off. Christopher Emanuel Balestrero. Address, 402478th Street, Jackson Heights. Assault and robbery. Nothing on the yellow sheet. - Ever been arrested before? - No. This man's being held for questioning by the district attorney's office. He's being questioned by the district attorney. Step aside. - Next case. - Step down. This way. Brooklyn 4. Over here. Stand in front of the microphone. Take your hat off. On a charge for grand larceny... The defendant is discharged. Rose. Felony court docket number 98: Christopher Balestrero. Officer, raise your right hand. Do you swear to the truth of your affidavit? - Yes. - I'm appearing for the defendant. - Did you file a notice of appearance? - Yes, sir. - You waive the reading of the complaint? - Yes. - How do you plead? - Not guilty. Judge, will you put this over to February 2nd for a hearing? All right, February 2nd. The defendant is held in $ 7500 bail. Could you set the bail in a lower amount? He's never been arrested, he's married, has a family and has a steady job. Your Honor, this is an armed robbery. That would be... ...a minimum bail in a case of this type. Your request is denied, counselor. Put him downstairs, officer. Felony court docket number 98: Sam Chulex. Officer, raise your right hand. - Do you swear to the truth of your affidavit? - Yes. I guess I didn't know what happened. You're being held over for the grand jury. Bail's set at 7500. - Bail? - Yeah. Will I be able to get out? If the bail's put up. Oh, but 7500... Who would see to it? Well, you've got relatives, haven't you? Won't they let me see my wife? If she comes to Long Island City Jail. Let's go, men. Seymour. Sign your name here... ...then here. Ward. Sign your name here. Up front. All right, let's go. All right, come on. Each on felony. These guys too. Balestrero, Christopher. Remove your hat. Address? 402478th Street, Jackson Heights. - Age? - Thirty-eight. - Occupation? - Musician. - Born where? - New York City. Hold it there. Balestrero. Balestrero. Balestrero. Balestrero. Okay, you've got bail. Are you all right? Who raised the bail? It was mostly Gene and Olga, darling. Olga, I'll never forget this. Never. You'll be okay now, boy. - Darling. - Oh, honey. You'll never know how much I needed you. Manny, what is it? - I feel... - We'd better get him to the car. Manny. We're going home now. I've got some coffee and lasagna and... Manny? You all right? I'm all right. - Oh, you'll never know. - I know. I know. What is it, Manny? I was remembering the police car sitting over there... ...about a million years ago. It's okay. You're home now. - Daddy! Daddy! - Hi, Dad! - Dad! - Hi, Daddy! We've all been waiting for you. Could you eat just a bite of something hot? What I want right now... - Can I have it later, Mom? - Of course. - I gotta lie down for a while. - Then that's what you should do. Come in, Bob. Mother tell you what happened to me? No, she didn't. I got arrested for something I didn't do. You don't have to tell me. I heard what they said on the phone. Dad, you're the best dad in the world. I do the best I can, Bob. Thanks for telling me. You're the best. Hope you never have to go through anything like I did. If you ever do, I hope you've got a son... ...just like mine to come back to. I never knew what my boys meant to me till right now. Dad! You ought to get some sleep now. Yeah. The lawyer in felony court said he'd recommend a Mr. O'Connor. He said we should get in touch with him soon. What does Manny say? Well, I haven't talked to him about it. He's too tired to even think about it now. Did the lawyer tell you where we could find Mr. O'Connor? Yes. He has an office nearby, in the Victor Moore Arcade. Why don't you call him. Mom, I wouldn't know what to say to him. You'd have to think of what to say. You always told me not to go out without my jacket, Mommy. Why did you and Grandma go out in the yard? Hello. I wonder if I could speak with Mr. O'Connor, please. No. Mr. O'Connor has left the office and is not expected back this afternoon. - Look, I know he'll see me. - Is it urgent? Well, I believe he intended to go straight home. All right. Thank you. We ought to get two music lessons today because we didn't get any yesterday. He'll give us lessons as soon as he can, but not now. Oh, hello. Is Mr. O'Connor in, please? I wonder if you could... Oh, yes. Is this Mrs. O'Connor? Well, Mrs. O'Connor... ...I'm calling because we're in trouble... ...and I was told that your husband could help. No, no. I'd like to tell you... ...if I can just think where to begin. My husband plays the bass fiddle at the Stork Club. Oh, good afternoon. Mr. Balestrero? Mrs. Balestrero? This way, please. Mr. and Mrs. Balestrero. - Hello. - Hello. - This is my husband. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Frank O'Connor. - This is Mr. McKaba. - How do you do. Do sit down, won't you? I'll see you later, then. - All right, Frank. - Please. Since you called my wife, Mrs. Balestrero... ...I've made some preliminary inquiries. And the general outline of the facts seem to be as you stated them. Everybody knows Manny couldn't be guilty. Everybody at the Stork Club knows he's not guilty. I spoke to Mr. Billingsley himself. He said not to worry. Well, then, you'll take the case? Now, that's what we're here to decide. Well, what is it you want, proof of Manny's innocence? We've been married for nine years... ...and we haven't been apart for more than two days. If Manny had done anything wrong, I'd know about it... ...and I know he hasn't. What I want first is Manny's own story... ...the full story about himself: His life, his work and all the events... ...after he went to the insurance office to raise money on your policy. Can you give me that? Yes, of course, Mr. O'Connor. Good. This will be an old story to you, of course... ...but it's all new to me, so take your time. Mrs. Daily, I want you to take down Mr. BalestrerO's statement. All right, Mr. Balestrero... ...let's start with some of your background. Start with your full name and address. Well, my name is Christopher Emanuel Balestrero. I live at 402478th Street in Jackson Heights... ...with my wife and my two boys... Well, that does it for me, Mr. Balestrero. I'll take the case. Oh, Mr. O'Connor, how wonderful. There is... ...one difficulty... ...which it's only fair to mention. I have little experience in criminal cases... ...and I shall be at a disadvantage with a skillful prosecutor. We trust you, Mr. O'Connor, and you trust us. We can't ask for more than that. - It's the money problem that... - Yeah. Well... ...let's not think about that. Let's just concentrate on winning the case. If we can do that, then the rest will take care of itself. Now... I... I want you two to go home... ...and dig into your memories and into any records you may have... ...and discover where you were and what you were doing... ...on these two key dates, the dates that the insurance company was held up. We know where we were the first date. We were vacationing at a hotel in the country. Can you remember what you were doing that date? - Not offhand. - No? Mr. Ferraro might be able to help. He's the owner of the hotel. Well, why don't you both go out there and make a thorough checkup. We might be able to use Gene's car. We can't keep Mr. O'Connor any longer, Rose. Yes. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Goodbye. - Thank you, Mr. O'Connor. - Goodbye, Mr. Balestrero. Of course. You were staying here those four days. But there was so many guests, I just couldn't swear... ...to where anybody was on any one day. The 9th of July, that's my birthday. Yes, but you know where Manny was that day? - No, I... - I remember. You had a birthday cake. You were going to have a party... ...under the apple tree. - No. We had the party inside. Because it rained. Now I remember. It pour rain all day long. - Not that it had... - Was that that day it rained? It was... It just rained one day while we were here. We played cards that day because it rained so hard... ...four of us sat out here and played cards at that table. You know, I probably knew their names then... ...but I can't remember one of them now. First one I think of was a... ...short fella with heavy eyebrows that grew out every which way. - Yes, a Mr... - I don't remember him. But we must have the names in the register. And then there was a tall fella with a... I remember he walked slowly and kind of stooped over. And didn't he wear something like a wig? Yes! A little wig, right up in front. - Yeah. - That was Mr. Lamarca. - Yes. That was him. - Lamarca. That's right. He was here the first half of the summer. And the third one was a tall fella, used to be a boxer. You don't remember any of their names? - No, I don't. - They write in this book. We just look the wrong place. Was the little man with the big eyebrows Mr. Molinelli? Yes, I think that was his name. Then here it is. Here is his address, and Mr. Lamarca address too. - Is Mr. Lamarca in? - Who? - Lamarca. - They're the people that used to live here. - You know where they moved? - Mr. Lamarca died... ...and Mrs. Lamarca... I don't know where she is. That was about three months ago. We're looking for Mr. Molinelli. - They're on the third floor, D. - Thanks. Do you speak English? What? What did she say? Molinelli is dead. There's our alibi. It's perfect! And complete! They'll find the other man, the third one... ...you know, the boxer? You remember him. And one's... One's really enough. It's my fault this happened to you. It's these wisdom teeth. I knew I shouldn't let you go down there... ...and yet I let you go right ahead. It's just been an accident, Rose. I let you go to the insurance company... ...to borrow money for me, and then this fell on you. We've been in debt before because I haven't known how to handle things. You had to borrow money from relatives and the loan company... ...and now we're going into debt to O'Connor... ...all because I haven't known how to economize. The truth is, I've let you down, Manny. I haven't been a good wife. But that's nonsense. You've been the best wife anybody ever had. Rose, you're just talking nonsense. You can imagine how we felt when we found out... ...that Lamarca and Molinelli had both died. You know, like somebody was stacking the cards against us. But since it happened, it happened. There was this other fella playing cards, and Mr. Ferraro and his wife... ...will help us find him. And we'll find him, won't we, Rose? Yeah, it was... It was bad luck. But we can't let that shake us. You'll have to search your minds and find other witnesses. Find that ex-prizefighter, if possible. We'll be able to use the Ferraros as character witnesses, at least. They promised they'd help us any way they could... ...with the hotel register and what they could remember. - Didn't they, Rose? - Yes. Of course, you realize it'll be the prosecutor's job... ...to break down your alibi, if possible. He'll have identification witnesses... ...and they'll swear you're the holdup man. I think maybe you'll have to go back to Cornwall... ...and dig up some more facts on your side. Now, this second date... ...December 18th. Did either of you recall any event or circumstance... ...that might be useful to us? - December 18th? - I remember I didn't go out much... ...before Christmas. I had a toothache... ...and my jaw was so swollen I didn't feel like working. I did work at the club, but otherwise I didn't leave the house. - Was that noticeable? - Oh, yes. The fellas in the band... ...kidded me about it all the time. - How long did it last? - Two weeks before Christmas. - See a dentist? Yeah, several times. And he'd testify to that? And if you'd held up the insurance office December 18th... ...this swollen face would be noticed. - Sure would. - Yeah. But this was not mentioned by any of the girls who identified you. Yeah. I think we may be able to make something of this... ...and, of course, Rose could testify to that too. Yes. I suppose so. Yeah, I... This swollen jaw of yours is something for me to work on. Have you got the name of the dentist? I have it someplace. I'll phone you when I get home. I'm going to bring in a handwriting expert because your printing... ...and the printing on the holdup note... ...will have to be compared and proved to differ. Well, now, I want you two to think again about Cornwall... ...when you get home. Try and get the name of that boxer. Try and recall any other details. See you again day after tomorrow? - Yes, sir. - Okay. Rose? Goodbye, Mrs. Balestrero. We're gonna win this case, you know. Goodbye. Is this usual? No. I don't understand it. I think you should let a doctor see her, Manny. I think I will. You mean right away? I don't know. I'm no doctor... ...but I'd say she's a very sick woman. Rose, it's almost morning. Haven't you gone to bed yet? No. Honey, it's chilly in here. You should have been asleep a long time ago. I can't sleep. Rose, this is the second night I've come home and found you awake. And you're not eating either. Honey, this isn't right. Don't you think you ought to see a doctor? There's nothing wrong with me. Why should I see a doctor? Well... ...when a person doesn't sleep and doesn't eat... ...and seems to lose interest in everything, maybe a doctor can help. We can't pay for things now. How could we pay for a doctor? I've been thinking about the trial... ...and who will stay with the boys. I called Mother, and she'll come over and stay. If you want her to. Rose... The last few days, you've... You haven't seemed to care... ...what happens to me at the trial. Don't you see? It doesn't do any good to care. No matter what you do, they've got it fixed so that it goes against you. No matter how innocent you are... ...or how hard you try, they'll find you guilty. Well, we're not going to play into their hands anymore. You're not going out. You're not going to the club... ...and the boys aren't going to school. I've thought it all over, sitting here. We're going to lock the doors... ...and stay in the house. We'll lock them out and keep them out. Yes, maybe that's the thing to do. We won't go out any more than we have to, but... ...there's one thing we should arrange. Whether Mother comes here or the boys go and stay with her. You wanna get the children out of the house... ...because you think I'm crazy, don't you? Don't you? Well, you're not so perfect either. How do I know you're not crazy? You don't tell me everything you do. How do I know you're not guilty? You could be. - You could be! - Rose. Rose. You went to the loan company... ...to borrow money for a vacation. You did that when we couldn't afford it. You always wanted to buy things on time. I told you not to. I told you they'd pile up and pile up until we couldn't meet it all. And it did pile up. And then they reached in from the outside... ...and they put this on us. And it'll beat us. And you can't win! They spoiled your alibi. They'll fix it so that they can smash us... ...and they will. They'll smash us down! It's true, Manny. There is something wrong with me. You'll have to let them put me somewhere. What makes you think so? People had faith in me and... ...I let them down. But it wasn't always that way, was it? No, I guess not. When did you first feel this way? When my husband was arrested. That's when I knew I'd let him down. Well, how did you know it then? I could tell. They wanted to show me up. Were they thinking about Manny or about you? No, they wanted to punish me... ...because I'd failed him and then let him down. I did everything all wrong. Well, didn't they arrest him, because they thought he was guilty? Oh, no. No, they knew he wasn't guilty. I was guilty. They were after me. They were after me, and they'll get me. It's no good trying. It's useless. What is it that's useless, Mrs. Balestrero? Well, everything. They come at me from all sides. And it's no good. They know I'm guilty. What's wrong with Rose, doctor? Is it her mind? Yes, it is, Mr. Balestrero. How serious is it? Well, at the moment, her mind is in an eclipse. She doesn't see anything as it is... ...and she blames herself for what happened to you. But she wasn't to blame for any of it. Of course not, but she thinks she was. And she believes this so strongly... ...that it darkens the whole world for her. She sees great, lurking dangers everywhere... ...and she thinks she's brought them on you. Now, there's a well-known pattern to what she's going through. She's buried under some kind of landslide... ...of fear and guilt. What can we do, then? The best thing is to place her in a controlled environment... ...where she can receive medical care. You mean an institution? It must be chosen carefully... ...and must give her a tranquil surrounding. And the kind of assistance she needs to find her way out... ...of this maze of terror she's in. She couldn't... ...be at home with us? Not if you think of her... ...and of giving her a chance to get well. I just can't believe that Rose... I can't let her go. She's living in another world from ours. A frightening landscape that could be... ...on the dark side of the moon. And I'm not there? You're there, and the children are there... ...but not the way you are. Monstrous shadows that say hateful things. Now, she knows she's in a nightmare... ...but it doesn't help her to know. She can't get out. Is it incurable? No case is incurable. I want her to have the best there is. The best for her. Here's your bag, honey. Come on, honey. - Mr. Balestrero? - Yes. This is my wife. I think it best if you say goodbye here, Mr. Balestrero. Goodbye, Rose. Goodbye. Would you come with us, please? Rose? Christopher Balestrero, please rise. These persons are called here today as jurors... ...to try you on an indictment charging you with crimes... ...of robbery in the second degree, two counts... ...grand larceny in the second degree, three counts... ...and assault in the second degree, two counts. As they come to be sworn and before... ...you may be heard. Be seated, please. Also, ladies and gentlemen... ...we'll hear from another lady who works for the insurance office... ...by the name of Constance Willis. She will positively identify him for you, ladies and gentlemen... ...as being the same man who was in that insurance office... ...on the date that the robberies occurred. You'll further hear from Alice Dennerly... ...another young lady who works for the insurance office... ...who will testify substantially to the same as Miss Willis. You will hear from the detectives who arrested this defendant. And this defendant admitted to the detectives... ...that he was in financial difficulties, that he had to borrow money... ...not to go to the racetrack to bet, but he had to borrow money... ...to pay off the bookies in New York. He was in trouble with the bookies. He had to pay them off. And what he borrowed, ladies and gentlemen... ...may not have been enough. This, substantially, is what the people's witnesses will testify to. They will positively identify this defendant... ...as being the man who committed the robberies. I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen, when you have heard and seen the witnesses... ...you will only be able to bring one verdict... ...and that will be ""guilty as charged."" Thank you. May it please the court... ...Mr. Foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You have heard in considerable detail the indictment on this case. As the district attorney has told you... ...an indictment is only an accusation. I would much prefer that the proof in this case... ...come from the witnesses... ...that we will bring during the trial. Because, in the last analysis, what I say to you now or hereafter... ...or what Mr. Tomasini has said or may say to you later on... ...is of little or no significance in the case. You must decide the case upon the testimony... ...from the lips of the witnesses as they appear before you. A defendant, under the American system of justice... ...is obliged to prove nothing. He can sit here mute and say not a word. The burden of proof lies upon the people. We are going to bring into the court during the course of this trial... ...a series of substantial, reputable citizens. And I invite you to scrutinize them closely... ...and to determine, in the light of their testimony... ...the guilt or innocence of Christopher Emanuel Balestrero. Because from the lips of these witnesses... ...it will be established to your complete satisfaction... ...that this defendant who stands here today accused of these crimes... ...did not, in fact, commit any one of them. I'm going to ask you to consider the... ...probabilities of this case. And I'm going to ask you that when the proof is all in... ...to see if you don't say to yourself that this is a tragic case... ...of a mistaken identity. Because on July the 9th, 1952... Was that the entire extent of your conversation with this man? As far as I can remember, yes. He said, ""Don't call anyone or ring any bells."" I gave him the money. - You gave him $200? - Yes. What did he do then? He left the office. And what did you do? I went in to the district manager and told him about it. Mrs. James, would you look around this courtroom... ...and tell us if you see the man who was in your office... ...on July the 9th in this courtroom. Yes, I do. Would you step down and point him out to us? Right there. Will you step down and put your hand on his shoulder? Let the record show that the witness stepped down... ...and walked to a place alongside the defendant... ...and put her hand on his shoulder. Did something else happen after you gave him the money? Yes. Ann was asked to go to her... By ""Ann,"" you mean Mrs. Ann James? Yes, sir. Mrs. James went to her cash drawer... ...and also gave him cash from... Before she went to her cash drawer... ...did you hear this man say something? Yes. After I gave him the cash from my drawer... ...he told her to get cash from her drawer. - And did she get some cash? - Yes, she did. - Did she give it to this man? - Yes. Do you see this man in this courtroom? - Yes, sir. - Will you step down... ...and put your hand on his shoulder? - Not necessary. - Will you point him out to us? - Which man is it? The gentleman standing with the red tie. - Standing? - Sitting there. How is he dressed? Navy-blue suit, a red tie, white shirt. Now, Miss Willis... ...is it not a fact that they had a lineup at the 110th Precinct? - That's right. - And how many men were in the lineup? Six, I'd say, seven men. And Christopher Emanuel Balestrero was one of them? That's right. What did he wear? He wore a coat and a hat, I believe. Were there any men in that alleged lineup... ...you knew before that night? - I object to the words ""alleged lineup."" - Whatever you wanna call it. No, I will allow it. That's his choice of words. - How many of the men did you know? - One. - And who was that? - Mrs. James' husband. What did Mrs. James' husband have on that night? A brown overcoat and a brown hat. Now, Miss Willis, will you please tell the jury how this thing worked? What were you told to do, with regard to picking the defendant out of a lineup? We were told to count and then tell them what number he was. What number did Mr. Balestrero have? If you remember. If you don't, just say so. No, I'm afraid I don't recall. Do you recall what number Mr. James had? No, he moved around too much. Did the number one man have an overcoat on? As far as I can remember, they were all dressed the same. Did he have an overcoat or not, the number one man? She said, as far as she knows, they were all dressed alike. Can you remember how tall he was, approximately, the number one man? If you know. If you do not know... ...say so. - I don't know. - How much did he weigh? - If you know, say so. - If you do not, say so. - No, I do not know. Your Honor, do we have to sit here and listen to this? The court will rule on what is proper evidence, Mr. Juror. The court is a sober judge of what is proper evidence. When the case is submitted to you, you will be the sole judges of the facts. Your Honor, may counsel approach the bench? Yes, sir. If Your Honor pleases, in view of all the circumstances... ...connected with the incident that has just occurred... ...at this time, I move for a mistrial. Your motion is granted. Foreman and ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...it's the right of defense counsel to make the motion... ...for a mistrial, which the court has just granted. We had to ask for a mistrial. There was nothing else to do. What does that mean, Mr. O'Connor? It means we have to go through the whole thing again. - Everything? - Everything. Wait for days on the calendar, choose another jury... ...examine the witnesses. Can't we just go ahead? Not after what that juror said, no. We have to start all over. We've just as good a case as we had before, though. Nothing's lost. We just have to face up to it all over again. Can you take it, Manny? I'll try, Mr. O'Connor. Thanks. I think I could have stood it better if they'd found me guilty. It's like being put through a meat grinder. Once isn't enough. They've gotta do it to you again. I brought it all on myself, though. I've been such an idiot. You'd all be better off without me. None of it is your fault, Manny. You've just had a lot of bad breaks that can happen to anybody. Yeah, what can I do? Have you prayed? Yes. What did you pray for? I prayed for help. Pray for strength, Manny. I don't see how anything can help if I don't get some luck. Somebody committed those holdups. Where is he? Maybe in jail already for some other crime... ...in some other state. Maybe we'll... He'll never be suspected for anything he committed in our neighborhood. My son, I beg you to pray. I gotta go to work. A pound of ham, please. What's that? This is a gun. Give me the money from the cash drawer. What money? Temper, lady, temper. That won't do you any good. Don't you come near me. Keep back! I never did this before! Let me go. I've got kids! I didn't hurt anybody. Let me go! Police? We have a guy here. Tried to hold up the store. Yeah. We can hold him. One for the detectives, lieutenant. Straight ahead. Manny, they want you over at the 110th Precinct. What is it? They got the right man. Everything's going to be all right. Manny. - It won't be long now. - What is it, Mr. O'Connor? - Where'd they find him? - They got him. Now, you, Miss Willis. Start counting from the right. When you come to the man you know... ...stop on the number. - Are you ready? - Yes. Okay, go ahead. One, two, three, four. Are you sure that's the one? Yes. That's all. Thank you. Okay, Manny? Okay. I can't wait to... This way. You realize what you've done to my wife? Wait here for me. Rose. Honey, it's all over. They caught the man who committed the holdups. It's all over, darling. It's Manny, Rose. He's come to see you. I know. Would you tell her the good news again? Yes, of course. There's no more trial, Rose. They know I'm not guilty. They caught the man. They know I'm innocent. We can start our lives all over again. We can start someplace else if you'd like it better. We have some wonderful friends, Rose. They've stood by us through everything. Mr. O'Connor, the Stork Club... ...the people up at Cornwall. Don't look away from me, Rose. All right. Rose, honey, I love you. This awful nightmare we've been through, it's all over now. That's fine for you. - Fine. - For you too, Rose. It's not good for me if it isn't good for you. Doesn't it help you? No. Is there something I've done, Rose? Is there something you can't forgive me? No, nothing you've done. Can I help you, Rose? Nothing can help me. No one. You can go now. Don't you wanna come with me? It doesn't... It doesn't matter where I am... ...where anybody is. What will I do with my life, honey? There's nothing left without you. The boys pray every night that you'll come home. - We need you. - Your husband's going now... ...Mrs. Balestrero. Couldn't you speak to him? He brought you good news. That's fine for you. You can go now. But come back. I guess I was hoping for a miracle. They happen. But it takes time. Rose?

It's a good soil, isn't it? - Very good. - It has everything. Let's start stringing, go to the fence. Bring the wire. Listen, men. Get the wire up. 'Midnight virgin.' 'Virgin, that's you.' 'A virgin for all to adore...' I never liked peacocks. Half of the time they're blue... ...the other half, they're red. I've never trusted them. Fucking peacock!

What atrocities you bring home! I had no idea. Go tell Asuncion to bring some coffee. Andres Alfonso. Sir? Get dressed to go pick up your mom and sister. Tellez. They must bring a lot of things, coming from the U.S. Go help them. Precious Margareth! How are you? Margareth, dear... How pretty you are! You're so tall. - Anna. - How are you? Dear! That's great! It was terrible, when they told me the news. I was scared 'cause she had fallen. - Of course... - Who fell? But fortunately, just a few bruises. You go in the front. Anna, you go in the front. Eber, open the door. When can you go to Neiva? We have to go, it must be beautiful there. - They're so big. - Go ahead, Julia. Yes, they've grown so much. - Eber, take us straight home. - Yes, madame. Yes, let's go. How's everything at home? The same. But things will change, now that Maria Josefa has died. After all, she was the heart... ...of that house. Mama suffered so much. She was in great pain. It was very difficult. I even asked God to take her. She had lost all her teeth... ...her veins were purple and all dried up. Please, don't talk about that. How was the trip? I wish I had been with her in those final days. I went to the woods, burned a stick... ...and here's the smoke. This song is a hit there. ""I, Maria Josefa Borrero de Velazco... ...in the city of Cali... ...on the 27th day of June... ...of the year 1956... ...being in full posession of all my faculties... ...declare before witnesses... ...this to be my final will.

The films are about to start... Asuncion, turn on the light. - Call the kids. - Yes, sir. Hey! Why are you fighting? All passengers aboard. They need you now. I'll take the house. Give me that... -lt's mine. - No, mine. My Mom gave it to me. To Andres Alfonso and Margareth... ...my equally beloved grandchildren... ...for whom my affection is the same, in spite of... ...of their different origin... ...and who have brightened the last years of my life... ...I leave the control in equal shares... ...of my sugar mill stock... ...as listed in an inventory... ...guarded by my lawyer... ...Dr. Jacinto Meneses. He will administer the profits for them... ...until they reach an older age. As for Asuncion... ...who is like one of the family... ...I leave her a pension of 600 pesos a month... ...for a peaceful old age. She will take this money from the charity fund. To Enrique, my brother... He's the one who lives in San Antonio. ...disowned by our parents a long time ago... ...because of his reprehensible habits... ...which disgraced the reputation of the family... ...and ostracized by his relatives ever since... ...I leave the house and land where he now lives... ...known as San Antonio... ...to do with... ...as he pleases.

I wish the best for you and your family. What'll we see? The one with Margareth on the swing. No, first ""La Emma."" No, ""Laurel and Hardy."" No, let's see Maria Josefa. What for? She's dead. Turn out the light. Turn out the light. -Get out of the way. - I won't. Let me see. AY, what memories! Look, look! Well, there's uncle. Rafael Francisco Vallecilla. A great doctor! An eminence! One hand blessed for surgery and the other for charity. He had 115 spurs. What? Mama looked great. Who would have thought it? Asuncion, Turn on the light. What was it? What happened? A bulb turned out. Don't worry. Here's another. - Go help papa. - Be careful, there. Go help him. Ready! Lights out! Hey, move! Who's that with the long hair? A writer. - A relative? - Second cousin. And where is he? In Europe. - No, he killed himself. - What, Andres Alfonso? LLook at the kids in their Scottish outfits. Asuncion's aunt made them. Look at the betrothed, real lovebirds. Who's that? That's grandma. -Don't talk about the dead. - Why not? Dr. Vallecilla eating cake. My God, it's Emilia! Sainted woman! This is when we snapped the photo. I still have it. Mama looks great. That's just foolishness, but mama looks great. Ls that ""La Emma""? Don't you remember? Look, she fell. Emilia fell, and she hurt her ankle. She wouldn't let anybody rub or even touch it. How horrible! He's a drunk! There's the black sheep. He ate up almost all the grass. There he goes again. Uncle Enrique's great but he's a communist. A communist? Look at that, Andres in skirts! Who would have thought that? Faggot, faggot! I never thought I'd see him in skirts, how I'll tease him. Uncle! Andres's bothering me. Andres Alfonso! Stop playing the fool in front of your sister. Andres Alfonso. Sorry about that. All fathers are like that, mine too. Want some gum? - Sure. - Here. Remember? Remember? How we used to fight! What do you think of mama forgiving Enrique? And leaving you, her daughter... ...two houses that are totally falling apart. And to you, useless floodlands. They're no good. - That's all. - What? No more films, time to go to bed. Hello. What are you reading? ""That's what they did in fact."" ""At daybreak... ...they went back to the prairie."" ""After greeting the nymphs and Pan... ...they sat under the oak tree."" ""They played the flute... ...they kissed... ...they hugged..."" How is James doing? Working like a slave. Always travelling. He'll be away for eight months, building a sugar mill. This is for Andr,s. I'm worried about him. He's good for nothing. I'd like to take him back to learn English in the U.S. It smells just the same. I do feel homesick there. Earthquake! Earthquake! It's an earthquake! Earthquake! Mom! Mom, mom! Uncle, uncle! Uncle! We still don't know what caused the explosion. Seems it was the boilers in the freight yard at Lara. All we know is that the city is on fire... ... and panic reigns on the streets. The explosion affected several neighborhoods. All we have left to do is pray. Our father who are in heaven... ... hollowed be thy name... We interrupt this prayer to give a last minute report... ... it seems the dynamite was placed in some military trucks. But we have no confirmation from the military forces yet. Colombians, attention! The following is a special news report... Andres Alfonso. Margareth. Breakfast is ready. The causes of the explosion are still unknown... This coffee is cold. Asuncion, pack the waffle iron. What for? There's no electricity there. The graves in Cali were open. There are dead bodies everywhere. It's a macabre spectacle of pain and horror. Asuncion. Bring me the covers for the bird cages. Yes, madame. This butter is rancid. Thousands of people were injured... ... and the number of ambulances is not enough... Andres! - Andres Alfonso. -I'm coming. - Does the car have gas? - Yes, sir. - And the van? - The van too. Go to La Emma. Tell Floremiro we're in Canas Gordas. Bring the generator... ...and all the fruit and vegetables you can. - I want to go too. - No, not now. I haven't been there in so long. Asuncion, you obey only my orders, alright? Don't start wandering around. Watch out. Let them go. Okay, go on. Come back before dark. You don't know how to drive. - It's going backwards. - We'll see. - Good morning, Floremiro. - Good morning, Andres. Good morning, Margareth. When did you come back? Yesterday. What happened last night? Some trucks blew off. 20.000 people were killed. Don't exaggerate. Floremiro... Father wants you to send the generator... ...and some vegetables. If you need anything, they're in Canas Gordas. I'll get that. Also get two horses ready. - We'll ride over to Enrique's. - Right away. Why are they that way? They degenerate... ...because of the crossbreeding. - Let's go to the swing. - Fine. Mother said one summer... ...they had to cut down the swings. Why? Because the pole fell down and killed a child. Do you remember? The harlequin of the mountains! No. Watch out! It's a nettle and it pricks. Then, where? Then you swell up like a balloon. It happened to me once. When you see nettles you're supposed to say... ""I see you nettles."" ""I see you nettles."" ""I see you nettles."" And you don't get pricked. Help! What have I got? Turn around, turn around! Wait a second. Is it a spider, an animal? What is it? Help me. - What happened? - Look. Suck, and it'll stop bleeding. Isn't it bitter? All blood tastes alike. Let's tell uncle Enrique about the will. Okay, let's go! Careful! Remember, Madremonte is around here. That's a mother who killed her children... ...because she was going crazy. She took them into the mountains and ate them. That's why they called her that. Uncle Enrique! He must be around here. Uncle Enrique! - Hello, uncle. - Hello there, how are you? - What's up? - Not much. I hadn't seen you since four or five years ago... The last time I saw you, I was eleven. You're so big now. You're a real young lady... ...and you look like your mom. What's happening in Cali? I just heard what happened... Some military trucks loaded with dynamite exploded. That's what soldiers are for. You're soaked. Come in and change clothes. It was awful! The roof caved in, the lights went out. We had just arrived. There are dead bodies everywhere. I don't want to go back. And look at this. Don't worry, it's not a big deal. How about a drink? Good idea. Okay. - And where's your father? - In Canas Gordas. - Is the house badly damaged? - Yes, uncle. This one's for both of you. You know what? Maria Josefa left you San Antonio. Go change your clothes. Go ahead, go get changed. There's clothing in the closet. Flesh of my flesh. Blood of my blood. Maria Josefa. My dear sister. - Where? - Over there. You know what? I think uncle Enrique and Maria Josefa were lovers. So what? Button me up, please. Let's show Enrique. That dress was my sister's! All this land... ...belonged to her. You didn't know her... ...before she went crazy. She was the only one who hid me here... ...when they were trying to kill me. Who? It was dangerous then, to say certain things. Especially when they were family matters. Uncle, explain. Well, your father... ...had bought some land in Caicedonia. On a spur of the valley. And one day, he was measuring it... ...when, PUM! Gunfire from the mountain. And they accused me. They said I had organized a conspiracy... ...against my beloved nephew... ...the conservative. But, why you? I was the black sheep of the family. I was the free thinker. The one who seized land for the peasants... ...who came to Cali... ...to make new neighborhoods. I'll tell you something... ...your dad, Margareth... ...is a very smart engineer. While he was building the sugar mill... ...he represented... ...an important dairy product company... ...from Switzerland or the Netherlands. Since he had a lot of cows, business was good. He made all the sugar mills and factories around here. And your father's a philanderer. He was always surrounded by ""birds"" too. ""Birds""? They were the hired henchmen who smoked in peasant homes... ...and robbed their land with the help of Meneses. I don't exist for anyone. Yet everyone has passed by here... ...refuges... ...criminals... ...lovers. I'm the black sheep of the family! That's why I'll die... ...as I should... ...alone. And I will be buried alone. Those earrings were my sister's too. She left them to me. What's in that chest? There lies the whole family's truth. That's all I will inherit you. Look what I found, Margareth. ""Even though time has gone by... ...you've been a memory in my flesh."" ""Not only have you been my brother but..."" I'm worried about the kids. I didn't want them to go. He always wanted electricity... ...but I don't know... Let the house keep its old charm... ...with candles. Will the government ignore this explosion... ...like everything else? It seems it was an accident. How could it be? How could they leave trucks of dynamite on the streets? That can only happen here. Still, I feel calm there. Not that. Have they sent the bamboo sticks yet? They should send them today. Hopefully, they'll let them on the highway. That roof needs support. Manuel Maria, take care of that colt. Are the others in the house? Wait here. Hi, kinsfolk. What's new? - Open these cans, Asuncion. - Yes, sir. Damn! This tragedy on the day of your arrival. You can't live in Cali anymore. There's fear of the plague. It seems two drunk soldiers shot the truck by accident. Nobody knows for sure. That's pure conjecture. Mariela, give me a glass of water. Of course. It's nice having a soldier in the family. Yes, but not in power. Eber, could you open this can for me? Mother. On the 13th of June... ... the virgin Mary... ... dethroned Laureanito... ... and a cop came instead. Cheese! Sure. Throw a rock and hide your hand, huh? And this is supposed to be for the injured, right? Delicious! - Let's taste. - It's as good as it is there. It's not bad. What would ""the stormy man"" in Spain say about all this? Who's ""the stormy man""? Dr. Laureano Gomez. Remember the last time we were in Benidorm... ...to see Dr. Laureano Gomez? The motherland! Such good cheese they have! Monchego and goat cheese... ...with good bread and cider... ...are better than Roquefort or Camembert. Better than this. Why can't life here be like it is in Spain? Progress, order... ...and good wine. How traditional, Julia! You know what? We Velazcos are noble. We come from one of the Meninas. Those were dwarfs who entertained the kings. Eber! Anyhow, they were nobles and lived in El Escorial. Sir? Eber, your hat. I'm sorry. You're such a noble person, Eber. Take the bamboo sticks to Cali. Then, find Margareth and Andres... ...and tell them to come home immediately. They must be in La Emma. Alright! Goodbye, Eber. Before God was God... ...and the Penascos, Penascos... The Quiroz were Quiroz... ...and the Velazcos, Velazcos. Before God was God... ...and the Penascos, Penascos... The Quiroz were Quiroz... ...and the Velazcos, Velazcos. Before God was God... - It's nighttime. - So what? - What happened? - Nothing. Uncle! Enrique! What happened? Uncle! Uncle! You who have tasted the richness... ... of the blood several times... Floremiro, I hear footsteps. The bandits! Be careful. You who have tasted the richness of the blood... Margareth! Margareth! Citizens. Cali has been struck by a terrible disaster.

Hideg napok (1966) - full transcript,"Set in 1946, this movie deals with the planning and execution of the January, 1942 Novi Sad massacre of 4,000 Yugoslavian Serbs and Jews by Hungarian army units. It was undertaken as a reprisal for a partisan ambush (in which 17 soldiers were gunned down). And it is mainly explored through the reminiscences of four participants--Major Buky, Lieutenant Tarpataki, Ensign Pozdor, and Corporal Szabonow--cell-mates awaiting trial. Ultimately, however, what you get is an extended debate over issues of individual responsibility.","COLD DAYS From a novel by: Screenplay: Cinematography: Director: 1942. Suspecting an imminent revolt of Serbian guerillas, Hungarian authorities decree a police raid on B?cska county. The police raid turns into a retaliation. People are executed without investigation, hearing, or judicial sentence, including 2500 ethnic Serbians, and 800 Jews, many of them escorted to holes in the ice, shot and dumped in the water. 1943. The Hungarian Royal Military Court declares, that no military or political reason necessitated such an extreme retaliation. All commanding officers, including Lt. Gen. Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner and Col. J?zsef Grassy, are brought to court. January, 1944. Prime defendants flee from justice and hide in Hitler's Germany, only to return after Hungary's German occupation. October, 1944. Former defendants are promoted to high rank. Lt. Gen. Feketehalmy-Czeydner is made into Vice-Secretary of Defense. Col. Grassy is promoted to Lt. Gen. rank. 1946. The case of the B?cska Massacre is brought to court again. All prime defendants are sentenced to capital punishment. All of these are facts. Our film is not about the prime defendants. It is not a reconstruction of the events. We just recall the memories and conversations of four minor defendants under custody. This is their version of the events. We are just quoting their words... What a tune! I once heard it sung at a burial... So many foreign songs! Are you even Hungarian? Are you sure you're not Slovak? Or Romanian? Or Polish? A sailor calls at many places... How could they count the dead? It's absurd. 3,309... Or those 299, crippled with age... ""Crippled with age..."" You can't establish that after the event! What do you think, major? What's the difference between ""old""... and ""crippled with age""? Nonsense. Four... Three... Five! Everything is chance! If I didn't happen... to leave my luggage at the station... no one could have appointed me the commander! A river fleet man! What does he know... about identity checking? It was an oversight, or a mistake. Anyhow it cost me two years. And who knows how much longer! Though, as far as orders permitted I tried to help. Six! A piece of good luck. Today I'd be sailing as a civilian! - Mine? - The Lieutenant's. - Again? - It's his. Where's mine? Sorry. We can't write you letters. Unfair! Why hasn't he any letters, Ensign Posdor? - I'm not married. - But I am! She doesn't write to you. - The tins? - Empty. I'd like to ask a favor. I wonder if I should... Please, do. Anything. I meant the letters... From your wife... I don't get you. What does she write about? Don't get me wrong. It's not the content. But the atmosphere... The sentences... A woman's sentence... Shall I read from her letters? - Shall I read from her letters? - Well, yes... But not quite... A second... I'll pick a suitable passage. No, don't select! Well, there are passages... Personal stuff... Jealous? Your wife is a stranger to me - Funny! - Your request is... Forget it! It was a whim. Tell me... Did you ever... deceive her? Did you ever think of any... other women? While... - I miss her so much - Not now! Before. Did it never happen? Well, of course... It did. If I only knew... where my wife is now She disappeared on the third day of the round up and as certain as I've become in these four years that she's alive I still haven't gotten over the first moments of dismay The round-up had been stopped and I was walking home I became uneasy at the door It used to be locked - Rosa! - We're here sir. - The others? - I've no idea sir. When I got back with the dinner-pail I found the ladies gone. I found the ladies gone. Mrs. Buky too. - The trunks? At the station? - No. Here then?! I couldn't make out what the disappearance of the luggage meant. My son found in the basement flat was talking about some lorry. What lorry? I had fetched you your dinner, sir. Stay here with the kids! I anticipated the worst. But the disappearance of the trunks could have eased my mind. No one rounded up was allowed to take luggage. Only if the Germans took them away. I couldn't ponder things then I was possessed with fear. Rosa! I know a Rosa here. This way! To the school! Rather, to the beach! Rosa! The holes? - Want to see? - Leave her! Haven't you seen my wife? - It's not a place for ladies! - Time? Fourteen. She'll be found. Hey, you! Take that corpse! - Into the water? - No, to the inn! Two German platoons came here and left. Perhaps they took them away. They often take hostages. Beg to introduce myself. Captain Buky. Go and find your wife! Rosa! Haven't you seen my wife? I searched everywhere during those three days, all in vain. Evidently the Germans took them away Fell into captivity with the Germans. That's why she can't write. I was glad to be arrested. I couldn't find her for four years They'll find her now! I asked her to be called as witness No one takes any interest in a woman who's disappeared. But a witness is different! Lieutenant... any news about my wife? I've asked Nuremburg. No trace. There won't be any. The Germans hold back their witnesses. They're not in this case. Do you accuse them? A difficult position. I know they're not guilty. But they anticipated their being called to account. No other people with the same foresight as they had in Novi Sad. This is an officers' room! - I'm Corporal Szabo. - Well... what do you want? Beg to report, Sir: the bed! - I've been sent here. - We're officers. - I wasn't told so. - Now you have! Get out! Pound on the door! I'm not allowed to. I'm in the ranks. A field officer, shut up with one of the ranks! I protest! Lieutenant! Ensign! - Join me! - We must protest. It's a bit odd. Odd? Did you say odd? Outrageous! - You weren't at the Academy? - No. Why are you here? Speak up. Speak. It gives me a chill. We got orders not to speak. - The General told us. - Which General? - Feketehalmy-Czeidnere. - That order is invalid Novi-Sad? The charge? I don't know, sir. I was patrolling... the whole three days. Did you murder? Murder? To you, to me. - Strict order. - Not everyone was a murderer. Stop it! Change the subject. If my leave expires three days later I'm out of it! I can't blame the Colonel who made me station commander. - But bad luck! - He couldn't see what was going to come. I'm like any other man who got orders. Still I'm treated as if I were different. All men are the same. Only there are lucky ones who get off cheap. Not better people, but luckier. I always detested Grassy. Grasch! He forbade families to stay with the officers. His smallest mischief! I never criticized orders but that one made me crazy! When the comb-out started I reported ill. To teach him a lesson. I didn't turn out. Only when I was appointed to command the remaining troops. The guard was lining up when I entered the barracks. Major! - Well? - Two letters were lost. Haven't you seen them? - What letters? - My wife's. Two are missing. Allow me. to look for them in your belongings. - Are you mad? - Let me do it or I'll call the guard! Don't overstep the line! Lieutenant! I was there when he saw his wife for the last time. My wife is... As I learned later the major had only run into Grassy. Maybe that was why he couldn't say goodbye to her. She was a tall, proud woman so different from the crowd that I knew it was her. I sent two river guards to accompany her home. She didn't board the train. Their son who was wearing a feathered cap didn't disappear. A feathered cap? - A feathered cap? - It was the fashion in those days. Tall, proud woman? To my memory My wife? Do you know anything about her? I didn't know her. I couldn't have known! Of course not. While in town she never left our home. If Grassy had got wind she was there I would have been punished. All this because of Grassy's unnatural order! I was writing her daily. My wife became jealous. And between us not without reason. I knew there was something wrong About my landlord's origins. I got good board and felt as if I were among Hungarians. I wrote to my wife the woman didn't look Jewish. She replied mockingly By defending a Jewish woman I'd shown I'd liked her. I was defending my landlady until some interest awakened in me. I found less and less reason for my wife's anti-Semitism. My landlord was often away. We were alone. The woman didn't resist nor was she quite yielding. No word passed between us about it. My love for my wife was never affected. Once away from your wife you get sensitive to feminine charms. I'd never had a blonde lover before. They left me cold But now I came across Betty. I hated the barracks. I had ten roommates there. She was a professional Betty will solve my lodgings problem. Put the money on the table. I may not wake up so early. Did you regret you took out so much? On the contrary. Too little. - What a nice lady! - My wife. Put it back! - Her season ticket. - It's got to be renewed. - I've been transferred here. - Permanently? Then you'll come again? I had such success with her that she wouldn't take any money from me. I wish I'd never left her bed for three days! But I had to go to the station Now we've come to the point! Grassy thought we were going to lead monks' lives! Meanwhile he changed his lovers but recommended the officers ""the greatest circumspection!"" I can't blame my wife for joining me! She might come in. Believe me. No reason for jealousy! She doesn't look like a Jewess! You defended her till it raised my suspicions. These are not the sort of people you thought them to be. I didn't say a word. She isn't your type. My wife comes from a Catholic family. She was taught by the nuns to hate the Jews for Christ's suffering and wounds. She could reconcile it with ""love your neighbor"" because she just avoided Jews rather than hurting them. In a few days she suppressed her aversion and made friends with Edit. Edit was so prudent that Rosa's suspicions turned in another direction. Their friendship made things easier on me. I never loved Rosa so much. Perhaps because I felt guilty. Don't take that for hypocrisy! I just wanted to live down my guilt someday. Edit's presence was a reminder too. We were like a honeymoon couple. Let's see! How much have you grown? You're still shorter! Jealousy made her blind. She began to keep an eye on Milena. A pretty woman living with her child in the basement flat. She was helping Edit with the housework. Her husband was drafted into the Yugoslav army. I did nothing to calm Rosa's suspicions. While the cold was freezing us he was mucking about with women! We were patrolling the whole day. Always on the edge of the pavement We were told we might be attacked. But we found nothing suspicious. What corps were you with? Beg to report, with corps 16. - Patrolling? - Almost three days. - Any casualties? - None. Or one. Corporal Dorner, on the third day. - Were you in his squad? - Yes, sir. I hadn't then been to the non-com school yet. - On the third - Cursed be the day! - Go on! - I'm fed up with Novi Sad! - At the trial you'll be interrogated enough! - All the more! We have to prepare our defense! You had one man lost. Grassy anticipated bitter fighting with heavy losses! - You had no gun-battles? - No. Whenever we could we went into houses to get warm. The first evening Corporal Dorner's friend took us into a school-room. Prisoners were held there. They were scared to see us. But we didn't touch them. It wasn't all that peaceful! The reprisals were justified! We were briefed. Christmas was the day appointed for bumping off all the Hungarians. The Serbs printed leaflets about it! - Did you see one? - Not myself. But I could believe it! It wasn't that peaceful! I was walking towards the station. It was given in orders that we should fire at the first movement. The privates shot like mad. They didn't have to make an account of the cartridges in those three days. She was only a railway clerk. The doc couldn't do much to help. She had it, the clerk! She was shot by Dorner's men. Don't say that! To make us responsible! The Corporal would never have done such a thing! What's that? In your hand!? Leave the Dorner squad alone! They served the country! Where did he get brandy? I got it. So what? From one of the guards. Now that you've drunk it keep the rest to yourself! Of course I will. I served in the Dorner squad! In the dishonored squad! The Dorner squad. Stinking peasant. An insolent one! Don't insult the squad! It wasn't us that shot the clerk! None can say we did it. It wasn't them. And even if they'd done it we can't blame them. But the confusion, panic Bad luck And me, perhaps. For my inability. Me and my men had no practice in making identity checks. We'll be late for school! It didn't enrage the crowd. It rather calmed them down. I had to start checking. I couldn't tell if it was compulsory for people to carry identity papers I had to decide. Bosun! Those who have papers stand on the right. There was no significance to this right and left. Still I felt like the master of fate But I had no idea what to do I have to escort any suspect elements to the school. School? What for? To teach them to read and write? Let me do the picking! Go on. I was glad to get rid of the task. But I felt uneasy. as the scarfed women were herded away. I went away. Commander! Where are they being taken to? - I know many of them. - Another train! Well, if you know them come and help! - Know her - Right! - Know her. - Right. - Don't know him - Left! - Know him. - Right. Don't know him. - Left. - Know him. - Right. - Don't know him. - Left. - I can't bear it - Well, go on! - I can't be the people's judge! - Nonsense! You're helping us. Permit me to send away the Palanka train! Well alright. Those from Palanka board the train! Get in, quick! What's all this? Don't interfere in my business! Damn you! Yes, sir! Let me go home. My husband is a war cripple. I have to give him lunch. The guards took my gesture for permission. In the street no one was safe. The patrols were scared by not having met the enemy. No wonder the clerk fell victim just like the Regent's godson. What have you done? You brutes! I know her! Don't stand gaping! Into the house! Careful! Put her down! It's you, you God's punishment I ought to have known all of them The trains continued to arrive If there had been no trains there would have been no checking and I wouldn't have been here! But I couldn't stop the trains Not your fault! If there was a cordon why did they let in the trains? A nonsense, militarily! Grassy's idiocy! He ordered a curfew. People crossed the fences. And why? Milena brought the news that listening to the radio was forbidden too. I could hardly quiet them But I was on duty I had to go. I saw no reason for alarm Partisans have been spotted. Killed four frontier guards. They've infiltrated Novi Sad. A comb-out's going on. There'll be firing? And then, if they hit innocent people? As if she had anything to fear! The placards were posted too late. The Hungarians got confused too. But they remained unharmed, I hope. Women can sense danger. She felt the third day in her nerves Then she disappeared On Friday Betty, too, had premonitions She cropped up - Why? - She fled to me of all people It's dangerous in the town. I'm scared. This note was left on the bed-table I'll have you escorted home. Let my friends also come with me! Alright. Go ahead. She had more courage, Betty, than most of us! The gentlemen from the town were still coming to fetch their acquaintances. I was sorry there weren't more of the courageous or corrupt people. How did they know there was danger? It was no secret what was going on in the area. The news of the mop-up reached me too. But those were in villages! I couldn't leave the garrison headquarters. I heard the rumors, but I didn't care. Now I often recall Nagy's words. they seemed so irrelevant then. They're just waiting to pit the Serbs against us. There'll be other victims too. They'll call it ""excess, accidents."" It's in the Germans' interest that blood should be shed! Imagine, if the Serbs reoccupy these parts! We simply couldn't imagine it. We were confident in our victory. Who calls the victors to account? That's why I didn't understand the General's briefing. His pugnacity. The results of the first day are deplorable! Those who feel weak go to the hospital! All my thoughts were with my dependents I demand sternness! That's all! I felt like running home No one else moved. I spent the whole evening with my family. A pig was killed that day. I only learned the next day an officers' meeting was held around midnight A dog's lying outside. Shot by soldiers. Such incidents shouldn't happen! Tomorrow I'll forbid shooting in our street! You'd better not go in tomorrow. Are you so afraid? Of what? Of a comb-out party. Don't let them in! It would be safer for the kids where no bullets can find them. Take them with you to your place! - My Angelica'd be delighted! - Blast him! When others were shivering and hungry even his batman lived in clover. That beggar of a yokel! By the evening the officers, too, were in a nervous mood. I let the manager's sister go home from the station and got a hotel room. I was seated among high ranking officers. 400 have been caught. 200 will be executed. Sent by me You're an optimist! I know Grassy. He's a madman! Thousands'll be put under the ice! I'm sorry. Identity check. I'm Colonel Ballay. Holder of the Iron Crown. How do you do? Ask my husband! Scandalous! She has no papers on her. My wife shouldn't be molested! The officers are staying here without their families. Colonel Grassy's order. The town is full of spies. I must see her card. Madam, I beg your pardon. OK? What was it for? Tell me - Can't you start a train to Pest? - I can't. And to one of the nearby stations? He wanted to get out of town My only advice was not to risk his life! He seemed to like danger He somehow managed to get to Pest He wasn't so lucky in 1944. He was caught and executed with other patriots. He spoke openly with me this free speech was his downfall. He'd come in nicely as a witness for me since he entrusted me with the command of the station. He stood by me at the officers' meeting. Grassy's words were flying over our heads like so many blood stained swords The enemy has taken refuge here pushing their faked papers under the noses of our Gendarmes! The ""Among Us Method!"" What's that? All suspects are shot and the 40 ""partisans"" must be ""among them."" More sternness! A real fighting spirit! My aim is: the complete annihilation of the enemy! We must show that we won't tolerate insolence! We must show that there's no mercy when it comes to retribution! What are we going to do? Nothing! We learned that we only fire if we see the enemy. Stick to that! I also said: ""Don't accept idiotic orders!"" ""Only if written!"" I said too much. It wasn't like that! That officers' meeting! There we learned the real importance of the events. I ask you to inspect the wounded gendarmes. Bring them! And we tolerate our sons' blood to be shed! We must show that Hungarians won't tolerate insolence! We are patient. Patience is one of our virtues! But it doesn't last forever! My aim is: retaliation! The annihilation of the enemy! Report! We caught some Jews giving light signals from the synagogue's tower. Jews are chetniks! That sounded strange. But then we got it. The Jews spoke Hungarian out of self-interest! They're more culpable than the Serbs! Those were never anything but Serbs eating Hungarian bread. But if a Jew commits treason?! Every officer knew that blood had to flow! Avenge our men! Rousing words ""My aim is: retaliation!"" Unforgettable. If Corporal Dorner had known that he wouldn't have gotten cold feet! Open up! Open up! What's going on here? You, Bolshevik! Hide away when the enemy is making mischief? - We've been on duty for weeks - Patrol duty! Retaliate resistance! Repeat it! Look alive! That night I got six toes frozen. They hurt like hell when the weather is changing. The Corporal swore for us too. He was as tired as we were. He had guts! For all the faults he had. Look alive, blast you! Dirty night job! Damn it! Pick it up, stinking peasant! So you do it! Hold this! Did you... did you just it me? Damn you! You'll pay for that! Take it over. My gun! Your pistol! Why must we carry this perishing thing? The pistol! Alright - To your place! - He tore off my button Squad... March! We were walking on... Looking for traces... A place to stop and warm ourselves up. Hey! Open up! Why's that light on? I've been washing. Have some! Drink! Brandy! Ask next door. Her arms were bare Her breasts stirred But they weren't so firm They looked soft That was her luck! Let us in! Bakija! We have no drinks. Who has? I have some stew. And some tea. Robbers! Help! Robbers! Where's brandy! Gottlieb always has some. A. GOTTLIEB. ELECTRICIAN. Two of you stay behind. Yours. How dare you?! How dare you?! I'm a taxpaying citizen! I'll report your tomorrow! This is robbery! Quiet! Let's go I want a needle. Let's go! It might be here. Leave it alone! Let's go! When Dorner got sober he took us back to the place There were gendarmes. Halt! Not a word about last night! Is that all? Two isn't enough? The electrician wasn't to be found. But he appeared in the schoolyard. Murderers! Killed my family! Don't call me names! Corporal! - He's after you. - Murderer! You killed my family! Corporal! Come here! We were expecting to be scolded. But they liked Dorner's report. Got friendly. As a reward escort them to the river! The other prisoners had to carry that electrician. - You're lying! - I'm not. When I was interrogated I kept silent. - But now as we - Shut up! - You told me to speak! - Shut up! We'll be held responsible! For these brutes! He came to see me that morning. I interrogated him as every complainant and furthered the minutes. Were they Hungarians? No, sir. Persons wearing Hungarian uniforms. Impudence! As if it had been addressed to me! I didn't think fit to ask Grassy about it. It might have put me in an awkward position though I wanted to clarify my wife's matter. So I kept silent. I decided to keep silent. He must have sensed my disagreement If you want to report me here's the telephone! This is the only line connected with Pest. The regulations guarantee you the right to do so! Want to be left alone? That irony paralyzed me. I forgot about my rights. All I saw was Grassy's face. I couldn't bring up my wife's matter. It would undermine the morale of the ranks if we were to scold them now that they've begun to taste fighting! The Germans have beaten Europe and you go wailing over a few Jews?! I didn't beg him. I only asked: - May I go? - Yes! ""Regulations guarantee you the right!"" Easier said than done! Some said Grassy killed someone who called the reprisals a massacre saying that we were taking orders from the Germans. I didn't believe that. But the danger of speaking your mind was not lessened! It's easy to be wise now! Not about those three days! Those who took part in things they'd never have done willingly were ashamed the next day to go out in uniform including myself. We leave the rest to you. Dispose of them. The chaos was growing. The gendarmes couldn't cope with taking the suspects away. They set up a makeshift prison. The prisoners knew old songs I got a slip with the words ""I also know a few nice songs."" ""Zsarko, in the cellar."" A daredevil! Can it be sad? Stop! How could you dare write to me? We saw you. Have me locked up here. On your authority. Don't let me be taken away! Save me! From the Gendarmes. I'm on their list. What have you done? What you would have done too. Three days. Half of it is still to come. I have to survive it! Giving himself up to me he got me into an awkward situation. Instead of the cellar I had him taken to the waiting room. He was taken away the next day If he were alive he'd be a witness for me. He was to become the leader of the local resistance. What resistance, I don't know. We were kept in the dark. It wasn't us that decided. But we have to shoulder the responsibility now! They're different... The Germans. They keep back their witnesses who will prove German innocence! That Grassy fled to the Germans from the sentence compromised them enough! Their precaution seems the more justified now. The Germans have always done a job for it! I was lucky. I was supplying tea By then the number of victims were several hundred. But I had nothing to do with that. I didn't touch anybody. I was making sure my rum wasn't stolen. Plenty of rum, in the tea. Meeting gendarmes we didn't stop. I showed by this: ""Soldier's one thing, Gendarme's another."" I liked Colonel Grassy. He might have made mistakes but he was a gentleman to me. To a simple ensign. Our men left these people behind. All the non-coms have a scent for is Jews! To the others! Take this rabble! Have their identities checked! - The lorry is yours? - It is, sir. We're taking tea. Are they getting rum? Yes, sir, plenty. You could lend a hand to speed up the work. This scum must be dumped into the Danube! There weren't many colonels that would speak to an ensign! Go on! I had no idea then where we'd be going. To the beach! I wish I'd jumped out. Let's go! Couldn't we wait a bit? We can't. I didn't want to know anything about this. I'd had enough of it What could I have done? Dumped water in the petrol? The petrol tanks were guarded. They'd have shot me! The town was teeming with chetniks. against orders? Men are like beasts. They go where they hear the cracking of the whip. Am I worse than a dog? Why do they keep hiding things from me? We're among ourselves here. Or aren't we? We took our group not to the beach But to the river bank. The beach was already full of them. Have a try! Wait here. Not much of a job. You'll help. It's deep enough. We'd need a plank. But we'll do without it. I saw some planks at the tavern. Two hand grenades! Come on! .... - A proper place. - How large? As would take five grenades. A tested method. That'll do. Run! Well done. Rum. For the cold. Bren gunner! Come here! .... It needs widening a bit. Scoop it out! Lay them down! Bring them along. Three at a time. Stop it. See what's up! My gun! I was ordered to go when there was most to see! The first man was just pushed into the ice hole as I go to make order a woman kneels down before me Offering me her son. Of about seven. ""What for?"" I said, though he had a fur coat on. I was turning round to watch the scene but she grasped me. Enough! How did I fall in among murderers? How did I fall in among murderers? No difference among us! Therefore we are put in one cell! Who killed that electrician? You! By not sending him to the hospital! My wife never knelt down to you! She'll be summoned! My son is alive, too! All I said was a woman with a boy of... - Liar! - Shut up! Don't you see? I lived to see those things I wish I hadn't! I did everything I could within my powers. I couldn't expect the Germans coming! Operator? Give me 115. The civilian lines can be switched. I couldn't set out in the dark. Discipline was loose those nights. I had to wait till dawn. I kept to the middle of the road. Ready for any attack. It's me. I wanted to be on hand when the patrol came. We were so anxious. Next door a patrol had come to check and arrested an old man. He spoke Hungarian though! Bring the bag. You'll leave. Go and pack. It's too much for us. Help her! Are you packing, too? I'd go mad without Rosa. Still I feel so mean before her Any relations in Pest? Ask her first. - Are you coming too? - I have to stay. Dress the child, please. I've invited my friend. No objections? Of course not. With her daughter. They're scared. It was a mistake to argue with the engine drivers. I ought to have yelled and acted. I didn't realize it then. We were so dismayed. - Don't leave us! - You stay here. Don't go! .... The commandant? Make way! Make way! .... What are you doing here? A personal affair, sir. Follow me! My only thought was not to give away my wife. Suddenly I felt sure he knew my wife was in town and he wanted to show me. Beg to report. You're sending too many people to us. Attended the meeting? Stop sending all this rabble to HQ. We're busy enough. Permit me to stop trains before the station. The trains must arrive. No alarm should spread from here. - Not sending trains is alarm enough! - Send them! - Passengers have been executed. - It's absurd, It's absurd, your kind of language! I want you to dispose of your civilians alone! I request the right to decide on identity checking. Dispose of them! And what about the suspect elements, sir? Don't send anybody in. They're full of faked papers. You've no means of ascertaining them. But there are other ways! I haven't been briefed on that. You are to dispose of those arriving by train! This is no check, this is a retaliation! Am I to check people or have them sent to HQ? No other way? - I can't see one. - You're discharged! Finished! My wife is... Follow me! Get in! The drive was so ominous through the streets that I didn't realize I hadn't said goodbye to my wife. Grassy dismissed me without a word. I didn't know whether it meant forgiveness or the end of my career. I almost wept with shame. Half an hour later my batman eased me. I've escorted the ladies and taken the trunks back to the house. - Good. - Your lunch, sir. .... Follow me. I demand admission! - It's vital! - I've got orders, Sir. Hundreds of lives depend on it! - This round up must stop. - Higher orders! The good news calmed my anxieties. I'm an officer's wife. Know her? The name. Not the lady. Stay here. The others will come with us. What can I take with me? Food for one day. We told you to stay! Get in, quick! I want to clear them! Take me to my husband! He's a captain! Get going! .... I learned there it was impossible to continue the method of the previous days. Very good, I thought. But I didn't express it. Kaszoni was already taking action. He popped up unexpectedly. He seemed to be furious. Cease fire! Cease fire! We shouldn't leave those! You go and report! - I'm Corporal Dorner, sir. - Cease fire! Escort them back! These people have seen everything. Let's finish off with them before lunch! Yet he figured on a decoration That very morning he told me: If I ever get a grand silver, it'll be now. I'll get it for sure. To my dying day I'll remember that I was whistling as I reached our door. No! I stopped whistling when I saw the door was flung open. Rosa! We're here sir. - The others? - No idea, sir. I anticipated the worst. I had to absolve my batman. He had brought my lunch. I nearly lost heart... But I found a hopeful sign, the disappearance of the trunks The indictment says there were soldiers who looted. I wouldn't believe any Hungarians did so! I ran to the beach hoping to find Rosa. But no one could remember her. Two German platoons came here and left. Perhaps they took her away as a hostage. Nobody knew anything about her. Everybody said it was likely that she had been taken away by the Germans. I made inquiries with the Germans. They didn't want to hear about it. Reasons of diplomacy. They need witnesses to exonerate themselves There really appeared a few Germans on the second day. They didn't go into the streets rather they helped out indoors. Using gestural language. But the detainees understood it. They had to take witnesses to prove later that they had nothing to do with the atrocities. They'll turn up from some camp. Those two, I mean three. Maybe from a French camp It depends on where they were when the war ended. The Germans got some order on the third day. They scampered off like rabbits. - The cowards! - No one asked you! I admit German commerce stripped us bare. But not the Army! Comradeship in arms is sacred! See? Well I see. Are they still giving themselves airs? Are they thinking that I'm the only criminal? For doing the dirty job? I was there on the ice. But I didn't touch the living! When the first shot was fired I was sent for a carriage pole. They shoved the spies in head first. But the water would push them back up bottom first. So we needed the pole badly. All the chetniks claimed to be Hungarians arrested by mistake. ""I was an officer,"" But he had no papers. Three women were wailing: Our husbands are officers! One was tall, the other roundish The third had the look of a rabbit They listed the names of all officers. That made them more suspicious. Suddenly I saw staff taking the tall woman to the empty inn. She kept imploring Staff said: We'll see afterwards! Half an hour later I saw the woman being kicked by staff: ""Admit that you're a Serbian slut!"" ""You'll pay for this,"" she said. She'd have stood at the end of the line but joined the other two. I had to go back with the pole to make room at the hole. It wasn't a job for one. We did it the two of us. Ten minutes later came those three women. They were clinging to each other... Sobbing Had fine underwear and lovely round buttons especially the I knew it was his wife. But that idiot couldn't heed. Now he's dead. Better to hold one's tongue! How strange! At naval college you studied ice-blasting as the most peaceful subject matter. To prevent floods, to catch fish you could blow holes with some TNT. Well... Here's the result! How could they identify the corpses? 3,309 Under the ice. What became of them? 299 crippled with age It's absurd! They have to prove it!

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) - full transcript,"On the eve of retirement, Kirk and McCoy are charged with assassinating the Klingon High Chancellor and imprisoned. The Enterprise crew must help them escape to thwart a conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the last best hope for peace.","Stardate 9521 .6. Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding. After three years, l've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomaIies in Beta Quadrant. We're heading home under full impulse power. l am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well. According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector. l have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir. Visual. My God. Shields. Shields! She's not answering her helm. Starboard thruster. Turn her into the wave. Aye. Quarter impulse power. Damage report. Checking all systems, Captain. Don't tell me that was any meteor shower. Negative, sir. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75. Location... lt's Praxis, sir. lt's a Klingon moon. Praxis is their key energy production facility. Send to Klingon High Command. ""This is Excelsior, a Federation starship. ""We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. ""Do you require assistance?"" -Aye, sir. -Mr Valtane, any more data? Yes, sir. l've confirmed the location of Praxis, but... What is it? l cannot confirm the existence of Praxis. Onscreen. Magnify. Computer enhancement. -Praxis? -What's left of it, sir. Captain, l'm getting a message from Praxis. Let's have it. This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command. There has been an incident on Praxis. However, everything is under control. We have no need for assistance. Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone. This transmission ends now. ""An incident""? -Do we report this, sir? -Are you kidding? What are we doing here? Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party. -That suits me. l just bought a boat. -This had better be good. l'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy. Captain, isn't this just for top brass? lf we're all here, where's Sulu? Captain Sulu. On assignment. Where's Spock? This briefing is classified. Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC. As you were. To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it. For full details, l'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy. Good morning. Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions. The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone. They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years. Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe. Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador, l opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He proposes to commence negotiations at once. Negotiations for what? The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford. Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet? Well, l'm sure that our exploration and scientific programmes -would be unaffected, Captain, but... -l must protest. To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide. Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory. The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees. Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms. Sir? Captain Kirk. The Klingons have never been trustworthy. l'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright. This is a terrifying idea. lt is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting. You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch. We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space. Me? Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command. l have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain. You have personally vouched? You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk. But a full ambassador would be better equipped... lf there's no further business, l wish you and your crew Godspeed. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. l remind you, this meeting is classified. l don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim. l wouldn't. We volunteered? There is an old Vulcan proverb, ""Only Nixon could go to China."" How could you vouch for me? That's arrogant presumption. My father requested that l open negotiations... l know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how l feel about this. They're animals. Jim, there is an historic opportunity here. Don't believe them. Don't trust them. -They are dying. -Let them die. Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months? We've done our bit for king and country. You should have trusted me. Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock. Over. SD-1 03, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1 701 Alpha. Over. Captain on the Bridge. -As you were, Lieutenant... -Valeris, sir. We were told that you needed a helmsman, so l volunteered. Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again. Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated -at the top of her class at the academy. -You must be very proud. l don't believe so, sir. She's a Vulcan, all right. Let's get this over with. Departure stations. -Scotty. -Aye, sir? Did you find the engine room? Right where l left it, sir. Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster. Control tower reading, sir. Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart. This is Control, Enterprise. Permission to depart granted. Thirty seconds for port gates. Clear all moorings. Awaiting port gates from this mark. All moorings clear. Aft thrusters. Thank you, Lieutenant. One-quarter impulse power. Captain, may l remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock? Jim? You heard the order, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6. l've never trusted Klingons, and l never will. l could never forgive them for the death of my boy. lt seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best. Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and l'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me? Sorry. You could have knocked. We are almost at the rendezvous, sir. l thought that you would like to know. Right. Permission to speak freely, sir. lt is an honour to serve with you. You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant. l've always wanted to try that, sir. You've done well, Valeris. As your sponsor at the academy, l have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations. l do not understand this representation. lt is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise. Why keep it in your quarters? lt is a reminder to me that all things end. lt is of endings that l wish to speak. Sir, l address you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation? History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant. -You must have faith. -Faith? That the universe will unfold as it should. -But is that logical? Surely we must... -Logic, logic and logic. Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end. This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew. Nature abhors a vacuum. l intend you to replace me. l could only succeed you, sir. Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge. Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow. All officers to the Bridge. Captain on the Bridge. Shall we raise our shields, Captain? Never been this close. The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal. -Uhura, hailing frequencies. -Aye, sir. Right standard rudder. Bring us alongside. Right standard rudder. Z plus 5 degrees. Channel is open, Captain. This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding. This is Kronos One. I am Chancellor Gorkon. Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth. Thank you, Captain. Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets? We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation. We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1 930 hours. I shall look forward to that. -Well, l hope you're happy. -Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard. lt might make the evening pass more smoothly. Officer thinking, Lieutenant. Guess who's coming to dinner. Energise. -Chancellor Gorkon. -Captain Kirk. May l present Captain Spock, whom l believe you know. Captain, face to face at last. -You have my thanks. -Chancellor. Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur, my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff. l have so wanted to meet you, Captain. l'm not sure how to take that. Sincere admiration, Kirk. From one warrior to another. Right. This way. l think you might enjoy a brief tour. -They all look alike. -What about that smell? You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk... You men have work? -Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am. Then snap to it. l offer a toast. ""The undiscover'd country,"" the future. -""The undiscover'd country."" -""The undiscover'd country."" Hamlet, Act lll, Scene 1 . You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon. Captain Kirk, l thought Romulan ale was illegal. One of the advantages of being 1 ,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters. To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future. -Chancellor. -Chancellor. Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here. Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet? l believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace. Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore... Captain, there's no need to mince words. ln space, all warriors are cold warriors. General, are you fond of Shakespeare? We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights. lnalien? lf you could only hear yourselves. ""Human rights."" Why, the very name is racist. The Federation is no more than a ""Homo Sapiens Only"" club. Present company excepted, of course. ln any case, we know where this is leading. -The annihilation of our culture. -That's not true. -No? -No. ""To be, or not to be."" That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. -We need breathing room. -Earth, Hitler, 1 938. l beg your pardon? Well... l see we have a long way to go. We must do this again sometime. You don't trust me, do you? l don't blame you. lf there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it. Captain Spock. Chancellor. -Madam. -Captain. Well, most kind. ""Parting is such sweet sorrow,"" Captain. Have we not ""heard the chimes at midnight""? Thank God. Did you see the way they ate? Terrible table manners. l doubt that our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy. l'm going to sleep this off. Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight. l'm going to go find a pot of black coffee. The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night. Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post. Note to the galley, Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions. Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge? Captain Kirk? -Captain. -What is it? l find this curious. Spock, l'm really tired. We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation. Where? Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us. The Enterprise? Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge? Sir? Chekov? Only the size of my head. l know what you mean. -What's happened? -We have fired on the Chancellor's ship. Torpedo Room, please confirm. Have we fired? ...0-6... -Uhura, monitor. -Aye, sir. Direct hit. Confirmed, sir. We've lost gravity! We are betrayed! This is the Bridge. Do you read? Do you read? Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes? Negative, Captain. According to inventory, we're still fully loaded. Find Chang. Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes. -Hailing frequencies. -Aye, sir. Kronos One, this is Enterprise. Do you read? Over. Repeat. Kronos One... lt's very hard to make out, Captain. There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting. She is still listing. She's spinning out of control. Restoring auxiliary gravity. Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk? We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace. For that, l shall blow you out of the stars. -We haven't fired. -Captain. According to our databanks, we have, twice. Captain, they're coming about. -They're preparing to fire. -Shields up, Captain? -Captain, our shields. -Shields up, Captain? -Signal our surrender. -Captain? We surrender! -This is Enterprise. We surrender. -lf they fire at us -with our shields down... -l repeat. -We surrender. -...we will not be able to respond. Repeat. Enterprise surrenders. -Are we firing torpedoes? -l wish l knew. Well, it sure looks like it. l'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn. l am responsible for involving you in this. l will go. No, l'll go. You'll be responsible for getting me out of this. We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace. l'm going, too. They may need a doctor. -Perhaps you're right. -Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed. Aye, sir. Have you lost your mind? l give you my word, l don't understand what has happened. We're here to help. Follow me. -Chancellor Gorkon. -My God. -What has happened here? -You dare to feign ignorance? -What happened? -With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this. Aren't you carrying a surgeon? We were until this disgrace. Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help. l've got a pulse. We can move him. l'm gonna need some light. Can we get him up on this table? Hold him. Hold him while l stabilise him. l said hold him. Sweet Jesus. -Can you... -Jim, l don't even know his anatomy. -His wounds are not closing. -He's killing him! He's gone into some kind of damned arrest. Come on, damn it! Come on! He's not responding. Don't let it end this way, Captain. Under article number 1 84 of your interstellar law, l'm placing you under arrest. You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council. He tried to save him. They've been arrested. Mr Spock, we've got to do something. l assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours. Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters. Tell them precisely what has taken place -and request instructions. -Aye, sir. We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners. What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid. We will be able to follow the Captain's movements. -How did you achieve this, sir? -Time is precious, Lieutenant. We must endeavour to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes. No way. l sympathise, Mr Scott, but we need evidence. Please accompany me. And if we cannot piece together what happened? -What then, sir? -ln that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats. The Chancellor of the High Council is dead! The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace. Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime. May l remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will? None of these facts are in dispute, Mr President. l have ordered a full-scale investigation. -ln the meantime... -ln the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish. Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon. Out of the question. Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men. Mr President, l share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but l am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation. What is the position of the Romulan government, Ambassador Nanclus? l must concur with my colleagues. But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Mr President, l don't know what to believe. l'm waiting for your answer, sir. This president is not above the law. Report back at once. Do you copy? At once. Enterprise to report back on the double. Do you read? At once. We're to report back at once. We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy. Of course not. Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called ""sabot"" into the machines to stop them. Hence the word ""sabotage."" We are experiencing technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative. Excellent. l mean, too bad. Mr President, I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place. Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss. l want to assure you that this shameful deed will not... Mr President, let us come to the point. You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father. I will attend in one week on one condition. We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation. We would consider any such attempt an act of war. We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth. After recent events, you will understand if l say l prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now. As you wish, Madam Chancellor. Attack them now, while we still can! Attack or be slaves in their world. We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide. War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming. Better to die on our feet than live on our knees. That wasn't what my father wanted. Your father was killed for what he wanted. The peace process will go forward. Kirk... Kirk will pay for my father's death. -Kirk! Kirk! -Kirk! Kirk! -Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! -Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! lt's a damn show trial. -Kirk! Kirk! -Kirk! Kirk! The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation. The Chancellor and his advisers... ...having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1 930 hours that same evening. Call your first witness. After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field. l found myself weightless and unable to function. Then two StarfIeet crewmen came walking towards me. But perhaps they merely wore StarfIeet uniforms. That remark is purely speculative. I move that it be stricken. CoIoneI Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories. lf the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking? They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots. Gravity boots. Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status? Aside from a touch of arthritis, l'd say pretty good. You have a singular wit, Doctor. For 27 years, l've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. ln three months, l stand down. You know, l believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question. Am l right, Doctor? -Objection! -Sustained. We all did. All of us. -That doesn't mean... -Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him? -Barely. -Now be careful, Doctor. Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he? l didn't have the medical knowledge l needed for Klingon anatomy. -l see. -You were there. You say you are due for retirement. May l ask, do your hands shake? -Objection! -l was nervous. No. You were incompetent. You were incompetent! Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink, -the court will have to determine. -My God, man! l tried to save him! l tried to save him. l was desperate to save him. He was the last best hope in the universe for peace. The witness is excused. There we have it, citizens. We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, James Tiberius Kirk. What would your favourite author say, Captain? ""Let us sit upon the ground ""and tell sad stories of the death of kings."" Tell us your sad story, Kirk. Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son. -That's not true. -Objection! Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin. Sustained. l offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log. l've never trusted Klingons, and I never will. l have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy. Again. Again! l've never trusted Klingons, and I never will. l have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy. Are those your words? Those words were spoken by me. Objection! My client's political views are not on trial here. On the contrary! Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter. This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him! Continue. lndeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank ofAdmiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law. Do you deny being demoted for these charges? Don't wait for the translation! Answer me now! l cannot deny it. -You were demoted? -Yes. -For insubordination? -On occasion, l have disobeyed orders. And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon? l didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship. You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One? -Well... -Your Honours, please! And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor? Objection! l cannot confirm or deny actions l did not witness. Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men? l am. And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination... Jim, they're setting us up. Your Honours... Do not answer! Captain Kirk, you will answer the question. As captain, l am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command. Your Honours, the State rests. Send to Commander Enterprise. ""We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "" lt is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged. l wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial. l beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence. So noted. Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted. lt is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives. Rura Penthe? Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard. Better to kill them now and get it over with. Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please. Hold. lt is Enterprise. -We fired. -That is not possible. All weapons visually accounted for, sir. An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. What exactly does that mean? lt means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did. Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present. There was an enormous neutron energy surge. Not from us! A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship. Kronos One? Too far away. Very near us. Possibly beneath us. lf there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her. Would they? -A bird-of-prey. -A bird-of-prey. Cloaked? A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked. All things being equal, Mr Scott, l would agree. However, things are not equal. This one can. We must inform Starfleet Command. lnform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible? Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us. They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything. And they would be correct. We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts. Assuming you're right, Mr Spock, why would they fire on their own president? lndeed. This ship will be searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge. -Aye, sir. -l do not understand. lf there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise. You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov. According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes. lf we did, the killers are here. lf we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here. ln either case, what we are looking for is here. What are we looking for, sir? Lieutenant? Two pairs of gravity boots. This is the gulag Rura Penthe. There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier. Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming. Punishment means exile from prison to the surface. On the surface, nothing can survive. Work well and you will be treated well. Work badly and you will die. Oh, my God. The universal translator's been confiscated. l'm sorry? He's definitely on about something, Jim. lf this is your spot, we'll move on. He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens. -He's got it. -And your coat. l'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit. Thanks. This will help keep you warm. l'm Martia. You're Kirk and McCoy, l presume. How'd you know that? We don't get many presidential assassins. -We didn't kill Gorkon. -Of course not, -but there is a reward for your death. -lt figures. We've been set up all along. Somebody up there wants you out of the way. -Nothing in here. -Nothing here. -Any progress? -None. We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them. Surely they have disposed of these boots by now. Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship? Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped. Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads. Why not simply vapourize them? Like this? At ease. As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorised phaser aboard a starship. Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse. l'm having the refuse searched. lf my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats. They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see. -Those boots are here somewhere. -Did someone fire off a phaser? lt's all right. lt's nothing. lt's nothing. Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port. -Who fired that... -Mr Scott. l understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive. How much time do you require for repair? There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing. Mr Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again. -lt could take weeks, sir. -Thank you, Mr Scott. Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command -our warp drive is inoperative. -A lie? An error. You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy. Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield. However, if l know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape. You got him, Jim! You got him where you want him! -You all right, Jim? -l think so. -They'll respect you now. -That's a comfort. -l was lucky that thing had knees. -That was not his knee. Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain. Anything you want to tell me? Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him? Let him know we're not holding a grudge. Suppose he's holding a grudge? When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one. -Do you want to get out of here? -There's gotta be a way. Three months before retirement. What a way to finish. -We're not finished. -No? Speak for yourself. One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru. Bones, are you afraid of the future? l believe that was the general idea that l was trying to convey. l don't mean this future. -What is this, multiple choice? -Some people are afraid of what might happen. l was terrified. What terrified you, specifically? No more neutral zone. l was used to hating Klingons. lt never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right. Try not to be too hard on yourself. We all felt exactly the same. No. Somebody felt a lot worse. l'm beginning to understand why. Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time. Time's the problem. You and l are nothing. But you heard the judge. The peace conference is on again. Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination. Unless we can get out of here. Kirk, it's me, Martia. Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe. -Except us. -lt is possible. -l know how to get outside the shield. -How do we fit in? Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you? -lt's possible. -l can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months. Candidate for what? Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty. l'll see you there. Don't disappoint me. -What is it with you, anyway? -Still think we're finished? More than ever. -l'm sorry to wake you, sir. -What is it? Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise. What? Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir. Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise. Sir? -You have hearing problems, mister? -No, sir. Klingon blood. They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here. This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory. Now we go to Starfleet. Now we expand our search to include uniforms. All uniforms? Take those out. -Continue scanning. -Nothing, sir. Clear, sir. Coming through. Coming through. Computer well seven clear. Nothing. Nothing. Okay, let's see what we got. Nothing. Nothing so far. Sir! Sir! -l think we've been had. -No, you weren't, Doctor. Get off at the first level. Follow the gang into the mine. They don't take girls. You are Crewman Dax? Yes, Commander. What is the problem? Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella? lf shoe fits, wear it. Mr Chekov. Watch me. What kind of creature is this? Last night, you two were... Don't remind me. Get in. Come on. We don't have a lot of time. Hurry. Up there. Come on, climb. Here. You'll need these. Quickly! Stay close. There they are. They're emerging from the beaming shield. -Mr Scott, start your engines. -Aye, aye, sir. Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe. Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier. -lf we are discovered... -Quite correct, Mr Chekov. What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death. -Leave me. l'm finished. -No! Bones, l'm wearing a viridium patch on my back. Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship. -Why, that cunning little Vulcan. -Come on. We're in the clear. Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away. lf they're even looking for us. This is listening post Morska. What ship is that? Over. We must respond personally. A universal translator would be recognised. We am thy freighter Ursva. Six weeks out of Kronos. What is your destination? Over. We is condemning food, things and supplies. Don't catch any bugs! Would you mind explaining that little trick you do? -l'm a chameloid. -l've heard about you. Shapeshifters. -l thought you were mythical. -Give a girl a chance, Captain. -lt takes a lot of effort. -l don't doubt it. Stop me if l'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you? l thought l would assume a pleasing shape. We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Captain. lf you say so. Are you crazy? She didn't need our help getting anywhere. Where'd you get these convenient clothes? Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue. lt's to let them know where we are. Ask her what she's getting in return. A full pardon, which doesn't cover this. An accident wasn't good enough. Come on, Spock. Good enough for one. Two would have looked suspicious. Killed while attempting escape. Now that's convincing for both. Surprise! -Your friends are late. -They'll be along. -l can't believe l kissed you. -Must have been your lifelong ambition. lsn't it about time you became something else? l like it here. Well, well, well. What took you so long? -Kill him. He's the one. -Not me, you idiot. Him! -No witnesses. -Killed while trying to escape. -Damn clever, if you ask me. -lt's a classic. -That's what he wanted. -Who? Who wanted us killed? Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you? His name is... Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a... -Couldn't you have waited two seconds? -Captain? He was just about to explain the whole thing. You want to go back? -Absolutely not! -lt's cold. This is the Bridge. We are still in Klingon space. Deck 9, remain at battle stations. Deck 9, remain at battle stations. They were beamed aboard a Federation starship. l could trace... Escaped. Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference. Are you sure? Will you take that chance? Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise. The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked. -She torpedoed Gorkon's ship. -So that's it. Not entirely. l have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers -are aboard this vessel. -l have a thought about that. Has the peace conference begun? Who knows? They're keeping the location secret. -There's always something. -Captain! Mr Spock! l found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them. But the uniforms belong to these two men, Burke and Samno. Not any more. Phaser on stun at close range. First rule of assassination, kill the assassins. -Now we're back to square one. -Can l talk to you? l wonder why they weren't vapourized. lt would set off the alarm. lt's possible. Now hear this. Now hear this. Court reporter to sickbay. Code Blue. Urgent. Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno. Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay. Code Blue. Urgent. Statements to be taken. Repeat. Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno. You have to shoot. lf you are logical, you have to shoot. l do not want to. What you want is irrelevant. What you've chosen is at hand. l'd just as soon you didn't. The operation is over. l did not fire. You cannot prove anything. Yes, l can. At my trial, my personal log was used against me. How long did you wait outside my quarters before l noticed you? You knew? l tried to tell you, but you would not listen. Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things l tried to tell you about having faith. You have betrayed the Federation. All of you. And what do you think you've been doing? Saving Starfleet. Klingons cannot be trusted. Sir. You said so yourself. They killed your son. Did you not wish Gorkon dead? ""Let them die,"" you said. Did l misinterpret you? And you were right. They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor. How trustworthy can they be? Klingons and Federation members conspiring together? Who is ""us""? Everyone who stands to lose from peace. -Names, Lieutenant. -My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed. Names, Lieutenant. l do not remember. A lie? A choice. Spock? Admiral Cartwright. From Starfleet? Who else? -General... -General... -...Chang. -...Chang. Who else? -Romulan... -Romulan... -...Ambassador... -...Ambassador... -...Nanclus. -...Nanclus. Where is the peace conference? She does not know. Then we're dead. l've been dead before. Contact Excelsior. -She'll have the coordinates. -l've already got him, sir. Standing by, Captain Kirk. Sulu! You realise that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations. l'm sorry, Captain. Your message is breaking up. Bless you, Sulu. Where is the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination. The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. l'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency. l'm afraid we're gonna need more than that. There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked. Surely not. Hold on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant. -Just the prototype. -You hear that? l'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant. The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim. When does this conference start? According to my information, today. Thank you, Captain Sulu. Don't mention it, Captain Kirk. Spock? l prefer it dark. Dining on ashes? You were right. lt was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation. You and the doctor might have been killed. The night is young. You said it yourself. lt was logical. Peace is worth a few personal risks. You're a great one for logic. l'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between. l couldn't get past the death of my son. l was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan. Gorkon had to die before l understood how prejudiced l was. ls it possible that we two, you and l, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness? Would that constitute a joke? Don't crucify yourself. lt wasn't your fault. l was responsible. -For no actions but your own. -That is not what you said at your trial. That was as captain of the ship. Human beings... But, Captain, we both know that l am not human. Spock, you want to know something? Everybody's human. l find that remark insulting. Come on. l need you. Madam ChanceIIor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honoured guests, the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer. She's out here somewhere. But if she is cloaked... Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes. 209. 206. 203. -Close enough to beam down? -Not yet, Captain. ln two minutes. 1 58. -Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit. -Aye, sir. Let us redefine progress to mean thatjust because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing. -Uhura? -Nothing, Captain. lf she's here, she's rigged for silent running. Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds. Transporter Room, stand by to beam down. ...53... ...48 seconds. ...44... l can see you, Kirk. Chang. Can you see me? Now, be honest, Captain. Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you? As it was meant to be. No peace in our time. ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends."" -This is fun. -Reverse engines. All astern. One and a half impulse power. Back off! Back off! What's she doing? What's she waiting for? Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her. lncoming! -ln range? -Not yet, sir. Come on. Come on. -She'll fly apart. -Fly her apart, then! Many speculated about my father's motives. There were those who said he was an idealist. Others said he had no choice. lf Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression. We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud. -Go to auxiliary power! -Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain. ""Tickle us, do we not laugh? Prick us, do we not bleed? ""Wrong us, ""shall we not revenge?"" Gas. Gas, Captain. Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel. We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas. Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies? -Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe. -Doctor, would you care to assist me -in performing surgery on a torpedo? -Fascinating. Hard to starboard! The proposed agenda is as follows. The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span. Phase one, preparation for evacuation. Come on, reach up! Captain! She's packing quite a wallop! Shields weakening! Shields up. All right. Now we've given them something else to shoot at. Aye, sir. The game's afoot, huh? -Excelsior's been hit. -""Our reveIs now are ended,"" Kirk. ""Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war."" Bones, where's my torpedo? Bet you wish you'd stood in bed. Emergency power! Gravity control down! Shields collapsing! The key, please, Doctor. Time is short. The hull has been compromised. -l wonder how bad? -Connect echobars. ...to discuss the report on phase two. -Alter circuit ""A."" -Sensor. l propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation. ""I am constant as the northern star."" l'd give real money if he'd shut up. -Plate, please. -Plate. ...and assimilation will consume... We've got a heartbeat. The Klingon empire, the ecological... -Key, please. -Key. Where's that damn torpedo? She's ready, Jim. Lock and load. Fire. To be, or not to be. Target that explosion and fire. Fire. As l imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month. Scotty. As you know, time is of the essence. -Out of the way! -Out of the way! Mr President! Mr President! Mr President! Mr President! Kirk, Enterprise. Protect the Chancellor! -Arrest those men! -Arrest yourself. We've got a full confession. Cartwright, just a minute. What's happened? What's the meaning of all of this? lt's about the future, Madam Chancellor. Some people think the future means the end of history. Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet. Your father called the future the undiscovered country. People can be very frightened of change. You've restored my father's faith. And you've restored my son's. Once again, we've saved civilisation as we know it. And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute. They might as well have prosecuted me. l felt like Lieutenant Valeris. Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings. And it's a good thing, too. lf they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in. Captain Kirk. Captain Sulu. As much to the crew of the Enterprise, l owe you my thanks. Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk. Take care. By God, that's a big ship. -Not so big as her captain, l think. -So, this is goodbye. l think it's about time we got underway ourselves. Captain, l have orders from Starfleet Command. We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned. lf l were human, l believe my response would be, ""Go to hell."" lf l were human. Course heading, Captain? Second star to the right, and straight on till morning. Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1 . This is the final cruise ofthe Starship Enterprise under my command. This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew. To them and their posterity will we commit our future. They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...

The Nature of Nicholas (2002) - full transcript,"After discovering that he is attracted to a classmate, an adolescent boy begins seeing and experiencing strange things.","Nicholas! It's a girl. Hello? ( Hi. Nicholas? ) It's Jenna. Oh. Hi. I was just upstairs. Right. Listen... I was having some people over tonight... I thought you'd want to come Tonight? I don't know. I'm a little busy. Vicki's going to come. Vicki? Your cousin? Yes. Bobby's coming too. Bobby? What time? Around Eight. Try not to be late. I'll try. Bye. It isn't much of a party. It seems early, still. You should've called me. We could've come together. You haven't gotten rid of it, have you? No. He's getting better. Don't fuckin' lie to me, Nicky. Am I early? Yeah. Oh. Okay, then. So! Here we are! The four of us? Yeah. Isn't that okay? You put your hair like that again. It's so slimy! My Dad puts his hair like this. Vicki's Dad is a policeman. Cop. My Dad. He has a gun. Do you wanna see it? Does he hide it? No. It's on the rack. Okay, then. - Here it is. On the wall. - Wow, it's neat. ( I could easily kill you with this. ) (-Yeah, I bet you could. ) ( -And your friend, too. ) (It's a bolt action. It kills rabbits...) I thought there was going to be more people here. ( - I could show you. ) ( - That's okay, I believe you. ) Watch me do it. Okay? Pow! ( That's great! ) ( Can I try? ) What do you wanna do? See the gun? No, it's just a gun. ( besides, you'd probably shoot somebody. you don't know how to handle a gun ) ( No I wouldn't... All right then, what do you want to do? ) How did you do this year? - Good grades? - Yeah. ( ... same thing ) (... what we can do in the basement...) - How about you? - I passed! ( I don't think that would be right. what would your cousin know... ) I like those braids. ( - well it was just an idea. ) ( - I'm sure I'll have another party...) ( ... and you can come and I'll be playing ) ( you can come up with x ideas, smartass ) ( oh, I had an idea. A good one. ) ( spin the bottle, again? ) It's looks so cute. Thanks. ( what's your name again? ) You're so stiff! loosen up! ( ouch, let go! ) That tickles. Nicholas. Is that what you're wearing? I don't know. Yes? He's come a long way. What if I don't like him? They we'll have a talk. Wash your hands! Stay here! Got the new Mr. Big Fist. It's a good one! Nicholas, this is Roy. Hello, Nicholas. I've heard a lot about you. How is work being? I don't know if I mentioned, that Roy works on trains. Something romantic about riding a train across the country. Even cathartic. Do you know what cathartic means? Yes. Oh. Good. Speaking of trains, I brought you a present. It's a pin. You could put it on your shirt or your jacket. That's really nice of you. It's so cute! Let me help you. There! I have to check on the food in the kitchen. This is a nice house. I grew up in a really big house over on Arburgh. It's so well-built. Like a wooden vault. I should buy it from you. Great picture. Yeah. Um, they're good. Why don't you tell me something about you? Like what? Do you have a girlfriend? You're probably too young for that. No, I'm not. Not everyone has a girlfriend. Not everyone's attracted to their friend. What would your mother say? What would your father say? I don't know what you're talking about. You can't hide this from your mother and me. Dad? Nicholas! The bird is ready. Great news. Because I'm starving. Nicholas, Would you help me dish? Maybe after dinner, you could give me a tour of the house. Maybe. It's not much to see. I know I'll disagreee. Did I ever tell you of how much this place reminds me of where I grew up? No. Big place around Arburgh. It's a lot like this place. Nicholas! I was thinking... maybe one day you'd like to come see the trains where I work. I know what trains look like. Not up close you don't. Nicholas... He was just offering. That's all it was. You don't have to. I thought you might like it. Well, that was great! I'll have to reciprocate some day. There's dessert, too. It's Nicholas's favorite. I can help, I'm sure. No, No. It's only a bowl. You don't like dinner. Did we get off to a bad start? I'm not really sure. I'm usually pretty good with... young adults. Red, ooh! My favorite, too! - Well, thanks for coming. - It was no problem at all. It was fun. - Really? - Of course. I haven't even had breakfast yet. You wanna play this early? I didn't come to play baseball. Is it - in your house? Is it - in your room? I won't let you. I'm sorry, Bobby. But you can't. Well, it's mine! I can do what I want. He's not even here. He died. It's the truth. Despite what's happened... It doesn't mean we still can't be friends. It probably makes us better friends. I'm not a bad guy, Nicky. Haven't you ever had to put down your dog. I would never do that. I guess I'm just more sensitive than you are. What's going on? Nothing. So, I'll meet you later, then. Thanks for the ice cream. My Mom doesn't let me eat ice cream in the morning. I don't see the harm in it. See you again, Robert! He's very nice. Oh. Tomorrow we're going on a picnic. I have to use the washroom. So! What would you say... if I said I really liked your mother. I don't know. Well... we haven't been going out that long. Truth is... Before your mother, I was with a lot of different women. I bet you knew that, though. The other night... I was thinking... I was going to have to win over two people. Instead of just one. Not that I'm not up to the challenge. So what about you? You have a girlfriend? Ah, you're probably too young for that. No, I'm not. Not everyone has a girlfriend. Not everyone. There's a couple of girls... There you go, then. There's this one girl, that has a cousin.. And I think she likes me. Well, there you go then. Think she would be my girlfriend? Well, I don't know her,... but you said she likes you, and that's a good start. ( what's going on? ) ( I know what these creatures are and what their plan is ) ( what plan? ) ( it's a separate component of a much larger organism ) ( this organism is made up of all these tiny individual creatures ) ( - well how do you know this? ) ( - well, it make's sense. listen...) ( each affect - a section of the being's anatomy ) ( the exciters - pieces of the being's sensory system ... ) ( the resonators - fragments of it's hearing system... ) ( the reactors, possibly an element of it's visual organ. ) ( do you see, now? ) ( i fear at that at this very moment they're gathering at a pre-determined place. ) ( they will blend, coalesce, unite to form this one gigantic being ) Tell me something about Vicki. What do you mean? Vicki. The girl you like. Vicki's Jenna's cousin. Jenna's the girl Bobby likes. ( that grid's coming with me ) ( don't try any funny stuff ) ( It's been a long day. my dogs are killing me ) ( got a creature here, Roy! ) ( bring that pickup around here ) ( all right boy, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... ) ( hey boy! get back here! ) ( don't waste you're time, boy, you can't escape ) What are you doing to Mom? ( it's magnificence. the thunder and glory! ) There's a little space where your experience can go. I'll show it to you. I'm not going anywhere. Nicholas? What's wrong? I know about your friend. How does that make you feel? I was just in the fort. The door was left open. Are you listening to me? What's going on? I'm sorry. Okay. We'll talk about it later. You remember the doctor? Open. Follow with only your eyes, please. How are you feeling? Sore. And stiff, too? Yeah. Well. Then I shouldn't have to tell you to stick to bed today. Actually... You better make it several days. He gave me these. You're supposed to take four of them. Four times a day. So you might as well take some right now. I don't want to. It's what he said. I'm sure they'll help. I'm sure they won't. Well then, you'll take them because I said. So then you're going to force-feed me those pills? It looks like it. Do you want some help? No. Do you feel sick? Don't watch me eat. I wasn't. Where are my things from the fort? Gone. You threw them out? Yes. You knew I would. I think I need to go for a walk, today. - I'll come with you. - No! It's a beautiful day. We could make it down to the river. It was just a thought. What if something happens to you while you're out there in the middle of nowhere? Could it get worse? The doctor doesn't think you're doing so badly. Please don't look at me that way. It's like I can't look at you in any kind of way. I asked nicely. Nicky? What are you doing? Going for a walk. Stretch my legs. What are you doing? Uh, just going for a walk. To Jenna's. Yeah. Why don't you come? Vicki isn't there. But you could still come. I don't think so. My Mom found him in my room with me. Before you took him. What were you doing? Nothing. What happened to him? I'm right here. ( don't look at me ) ( don't look at me ) ( don't look at me ) All in the past. It's just a part of growing up. There are a lot of little houses down this road.
