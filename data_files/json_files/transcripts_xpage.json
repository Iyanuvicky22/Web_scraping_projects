{"title": "Xenia (2014) - full transcript", "plot": "Strangers in their own birthplace, 16-year-old Danny and 18-year-old Odysseus cross the entire country in search of their Greek father, after their Albanian mother passes away. Determined to force him to acknowledge paternity, little do they know that the road to the much-coveted Greek citizenship is paved with ghosts from the past, adult savagery and a dream that needs to come true, no matter what. Reaching the end of this initiatory journey they eventually come of age even if Greece refuses to follow.", "content": "Dido, I told you to stay in the bag! Naughty boy! Dido? Yes. Oh, Dany! Dido, you stay in there, OK? Today's not the best of days. Want to do something else? Don't worry. Some other time. Day after tomorrow? I can't. I'm going tonight! Going? Where to? Athens. What for? Business. What kind of business in Athens? I'll tell you when I get back. Hey, can you give me an advance? I'll pay you back. I promise. - For the trip? - Yeah. When will you be back? When I've finished my business. Of course. How's that? Cool! Thanks a lot! Hey, those spells you told me about… What? Those absences, do you still have them? No. I'm good! - Are you sure? - Yeah. OK, I gotta run. Come now… Take care. Yeah. And call me, huh? Could you buy me some credit to call you? OK. Who's that? Who? Her? Patty Pravo. How do you know her? She's a goddess! - Really? - Yeah. OK, bye! Put on your jacket. (in Albanian) It's chilly. Dido, this is Athens! Well, Piraeus, really. Smile! Toast with ham, cheese, bacon, mustard, and omelet. Dany! Hey, Ody! Don't call me Ody. Why're you here? I told you. Toast with… - When did you arrive? - An hour ago. With mustard! Dimitra! - Can you make it? - OK. With mustard, Dimitra! - You look cute! - I said not to come to Athens. Well, I'm here now. If you've come to make trouble, beat it! (in Albanian) You hear me? Go back to your mother in Crete. I can't! Why not? Jenny's no more. What do you mean? She's dead. Odysseas, the toast's ready! 10 days ago. Are you shitting me? I called you several times, but you didn't answer. I couldn't blurt it out in a text. It's your birthday soon, so I preferred to come see you. But I spoke to her. I know. I came home 2 days later and found her on the sofa. Pulmonary edema, the doctor said. She had too much to drink. And took her pills. Maybe a bit too much. What'll I do with you? You belong behind the counter. Not talking to friends. If you're not happy, there are plenty of others waiting. Wait here. What about money for the funeral? Jenny had 2,000 euros in the bank. A fortune! She could've had millions. Yes. If she hadn't burned out. It wasn't her fault! She worked hard. Stop saying that! Hello. A pack of the usual. And this. Thanks. Let's go. It's not Bollywood here! - Don't look. Stay cool. - Why? You're in Greece and don't speak Greek? Fucking bastards! Be quiet. Those fascists don't scare me! When they're in a group, keep quiet. This is Athens. It's the same in Crete. We don't look like Albanians. You look like a fag. That's worse. We don't look Albanian, but we are. Half. You're Albanian, Dany! And a fag. The mountains… and the sea. Perfect! Hey… Don't shame me in front of my roommate. Look at me, OK? Yes, Dad! Ody! It's ready! SUGAR Come eat! Ody, we're eating! After Athens and Patras, the casting… Leave it. … Of \"Greek Star\" continues in Thessalonica. Sign up on the site… Don't call me Ody! … and make your dreams come true! Who'll be the new Greek star? My brother, motherfuckers! - Who? - Ody. He'd win easily. It's \"Greek Star\", not \"Albanian Star\"! The nationality doesn't matter. You've got hidden talents? Great! (in Albanian) If you're a star, you'll get your Greek girl at last. Go on, tell him, Ody! Shut up, you asshole! Stop ranting. Your mother's dead, dammit. Fuck you! It was Jenny's dream for you to take part in a talent show! You get fucked — it'll do you good! Eat, it's going cold. Our mother was a singer. A great voice. She could sing anything. Italian, Greek… Ody inherited her talent. It's sweet. Good, huh? Come with me. - Where to? - Come on! - Where? - Hurry up! Hang on. - Come on! - My bag. Hurry up! Bye. This way. It's great here! If you want to stay in Athens, you'll have to calm down. I've not done a thing! Your mother's dead, you heartless bastard. I'm heartless? What about you? You abandoned her! That's not true. She sent me to her uncle when I was 14! Just for the summer. And you never came back. What for? To put her to bed drunk every night? And put up with her asshole boyfriends? To not leave me alone! I was the one who took care of it all! So, don't come it with me! Fuck you! Here. No, thanks. Come on, Dido. Is that the Acropolis? Yes. Still got that rabbit? Yes, why? You're 16, goddammit! In 2 months. And you're nearly 18! - Fuck it! - Why? Jenny screwed up, she lost her residence permit. So, we did, too. She didn't tell you? No. In a few days' time, I could be deported. Thanks, Jenny! What'll you do? I dunno. An NGO lawyer who deals with immigrants said she'd help me. You're in a mess. You're not eating? Oh, I didn't tell you! What? Before she died, Mom said that \"The Unspeakable\" was alive. What? Tassos told her that \"The Unspeakable\" lived in Thessalonica. Tassos? How did she find Tassos? He called Jenny. To make friends again. Tassos ran into \"The Unspeakable\" in a club. He remarried and changed his name. He's loaded, too! She was glad to have found Tassos, but she started drinking and insulting \"The Unspeakable\". As usual. She wanted him to do a DNA test since I'm a minor. To get some money. Bullshit. Why? We could get the money and Greek nationality! No-one could deport you! - If he'd wanted to find us… - Screw him! We have no father. Forget it! What're you doing? Making the bed. - We're sleeping here? - Yes. It's too hot downstairs. Give me a hand. What'll you have? A Coke. Drink your Coke and get out. Minors can't come in here. - So, you're Jenny's son? - Yes. - You're looking for Tassos? - Yes. Why don't you ask your mother? She died 2 weeks ago. Sorry. That's why I'm looking for him. They'd fallen out. Yes, I know. I fell out with him, too, 5 or 6 years ago. He'd become unmanageable. He drank and fought with everyone. She told me he'd opened a club. I can't remember where. So I heard. In Larissa. The Paradiso. Darling! The Paradiso? Yes, that's it. - Hey, Mr Costa. - Hey, Moustafa. - A beer. - Denis, a beer. What's your name? Dany. Hi. Moustafa. Dance. Come! No. Dance! That. With that. And that. You long in Greece? I was born here. You not Albanian? I am Albanian! - Here? - Yes. How much do you charge? 20 euros. But too hard find clients. Me want 1,000 euros to go Italy. You come with me? I can't. Why not? I'm going to Thessalonica. Thessalonica? Why? To find my father. Fascists! Get outta here! The fascists. Death to Arabs! Greece for the Greeks! What're you looking at? Leave her! Leave her, you cunts! Leave him alone! Run! Run! Where are you? Hey, you. Come here! I brought the Albanian kid. Leave us alone for a minute. Hi. I'm Antigone, Odysseas's lawyer. We spoke on the phone. Did they do that to you here? What's that? What? His shoulder's all bruised! No idea. I never saw the kid before. Please come. The car's waiting. Take off his cuffs. We obey orders, ma'am. Come with me. Now what? The cuffs aren't necessary! Take them off at once. Please! He's a minor and it's the law. I was born here. And I'm a minor! Yes, that's why we can win. But we're half Greek, too. Your brother's waiting outside. - Where's my bag? - You'll get it when you leave. - Don't talk to him. - One minute! One minute. You screwed up again. Are you OK? Everything's alright. He'll go to a center. We'll try to get him out as soon as possible. - Don't let me go there! - It's only temporary. Definitely! And security's not tight. Let's go to Thessalonica. It's now or never! You'll win \"Greek Star\". And we'll get the money and Greek nationality. Like Jenny said. Forget it. Let's go! Ody, please! Hi. Toast with ham, cheese, and mustard. Coming right up. What're you doing here? I left. You ran away? It really sucked there. Let me sleep. I'm beat. Wake up! We're leaving! What? I've been looking for you for an hour. What is it? We missed the bus! Come on. It's OK. Relax. Come on. There you are, my boy! I can't walk any further in this heat. Serves you right. Come on. Let's hitch a ride. With your look? What's wrong with it? Forget it. Let's rehearse your song. No. I thought of a more recent song. No. It'll be \"Tutt'al più\" like Mom taught you. I assure you! Don't forget, Patty Pravo brings luck! I don't have a thing to wear. You're fine like that. Miss Tassos will have some vintage clothes for you. I'll do your hair. Oh, great! You talk. - Good evening. - Hello. We want to talk to Tassos Peris. Mr Tassos? What about? - We're family. - Family. Wait here. What's up, boys? I don't believe it! Maria Sonia, our Ukrainian star! She'll have the whole of Greece at her feet! And now, a song… for a goddess who left too soon. For Jenny! Perhaps… You'll go one day perhaps… Hey, Tassos sent me over. Sit down. Odysseas. That's Dany. Perhaps… Everything will change perhaps And we will mourn perhaps Our lost dreams… Sit down. Get the milk out of the fridge. Yes, Tassos. Bottom left. Thanks. Why are you going to Thessalonica? To make Ody the new star, or to find \"The Unspeakable\"? I called him that. Both reasons. Why? In the fridge. Because, my dear, you could be the next star if you've kept your voice. I get by OK. But as for getting hold of the money… I'll handle him. No-one messes with me! I'd noticed. Got anything sweet? Again? You'll start attracting flies! Here. - Thanks. - Just one. Say you find him. What if I were wrong? Aren't you sure? You told Jenny it was him! Yes, the guy I saw in a club in Thessalonica. He's a far right candidate over there. Far right? That's right. It's his day job. At night, he offers protection to clubs. Drugs, girls, the usual stuff. Scumbag! In the fridge. You're not sure it's him? Listen. If it's him, he's changed his name. He's called Christopoulos. His first name's still Lefteris. He's changed a lot in 15 years. 12 and a bit… 12 years, hey? - What does he look like? - Physically? Me or Odysseas? You don't remember him? No. When he left, you didn't eat for a month. I don't remember. I do, a bit. You? You were scarcely 2! I'd fall asleep on his chest. He was really hairy. We can't remember things from when we're 2. Let's go into the living room. Here. Tassos? Yes. This photo was at your place, in Crete. Song Festival, 1981. 1st prize, it says. Past glories. Instead of crying about it, smoke a joint. As Jenny's sons, you can't mind. I do. Cut the crap. So, what was he like? Who? \"The Unspeakable\". He was so hot when he was young. Tall, dark… A real hunk. Darker than you! A lot more than you, kid! When I look at the two of you, you don't look like him. You look like your mother. 'Evening! It's Achmad. We've lived together for 3 years. Without him, I'd be with your mother now. Did everything go OK at the club? Yes. Except Costas who was bitching, as usual. He's on the way out. I made some toast. Thanks. Listen… What a coincidence! You'll never guess what I was listening to, 2 days ago. Ready? Patty! A goddess. Your mother adored her. Do you remember our dance? Let's see. Come on, Dany. 5, 6, 7, 8! And change. Lefteris Christopoulos candidate \"I'm not a fascist, I'm a patriot.\" That's great, Odysseas! You didn't even rehearse it! Maria, you've made progress. It's him! He's shit-hot! You have a very pretty voice. You sing well together. That's rare. For the audition, you should choose a Greek song. Something light-hearted and upbeat. You know what I mean. We thought about that, but… Let's take it from the top. Put your cigarette out. Now! Sorry. Hey, Dany. - What's up? - We're rehearsing. Why are you rehearsing? For the audition. We thought of a Greek song. What? We already know what you're going to sing. The jury doesn't like shitty Greek songs. It's not a shitty song. Don't forget you were raised on them for years! With Jenny, we listened to Patty Pravo. You'll sing Patty Pravo! No-one asked you! - Calm down, kid. - No way. - Shut up. - I won't shut up! This third-rate old queen can't suddenly tell us what to do! When we needed him, he ran away. Now he's lecturing us. Fuck him! Shut your mouth! Fuck you! Dany, stop. Stop it! Leave him alone. I don't mind. I can't breathe! What's going on? Calm down. You'll sing \"Tutt'al più\", OK? Go fuck the lot of you! It's the fag from earlier on. (in Albanian) Look at this faggot. Do you want to suck my lollipop? I don't suck limp dicks. Ask your buddy. He's Albanian like us! What did you say? Asshole! Say that again, ass bandit! Look at your faces in the mirror! Shitheads! - Forget it, Baskim! - No way. Say that again! I'll bust your ass — you'll like that. Aren't you sick of them screwing you? He puts us Albanians to shame. The real shame is your needle pricks. Say that again! Fuck you. Stop it! Come here, you fag. He's got a gun! Leave him alone! Stop it! Drop that gun! Shit, he's hit! Come on. Run! This way. Stop! Stay where you are! I can't carry on. Sit down. My bag. Let me see your leg. Gently. Is it sprained? I dunno. Have a rest. C'mon, let's go. I can't… Get on my back. It's OK. - Wait here. - Where are you going? Are you hurt, Dido? Here. Don't drink it all. That's enough. Drink. Where's the gun? I dunno. I dropped it. - Are you sure? - Yes. If they find it, we're done for. Take him. What? Take him. Why? He's suffering. Kill him so he stops suffering. What? Take him! Dany, you're freaking me out! Kill him! I can't bear to see him! Will you cut the crap? I can't bear to see him. Kill him! That's enough! Take him! Please! Alright, alright! - Kill him! - Kill what? Kill him! Are you joking? It's Dido. Do it! Do what? It's Dido. Kill him. He's in pain. Do what, dammit? Look! Sorry. Calm down. Is there anyone here? It's empty. I always dreamed of living in a four-star hotel. Shit, my battery's dead. Does yours work? 100 calls from Miss Tassos. Give it to me. Hello? At last! Are you OK? Yes. Thank God. Just a moment. Bye, boys. Thanks very much. Where are you? I dunno. Far away. In a hotel. We ran into a spot of trouble… I know. The police just left. You were seen in the club. Who fired? The kid? Yes. I knew it. Where did he find the gun? In Crete? I dunno. I guess so. He's lucky. He hit the guy in the leg. He'll survive. Thank God! The police are after you. I said nothing. The captain's a good customer. I said you were rentboys from Trikala. I hope you're not near there. I don't think so. Lay low for a few days. They'll stop looking for you. How's the kid? He hurt his ankle. Serves him right! Put him on. Here. Hello. You were right. I'm sorry… What about? You know what I mean! Does it hurt? No. It'll be OK. Listen, tell your brother if things screw up with \"The Unspeakable\", I'll take over. With Achmad. Wouldn't he be a great dad? Right. Be careful. - Yes, Tassos. - Bye, Dany. Where did you find the gun? - In Crete. - Did you steal it? Not exactly. What did you want to do with it? I dunno. It can come in handy. Are you shitting me? Do you realize what you're saying? You almost killed someone. Do you understand? They attacked me first. Have you gone insane? It's not a toy. You don't go shooting at people. You can hit and punch, but you can't shoot! Do you wanna fuck everything up? I want to go to Thessalonica and you to become a star. Oh, yeah? By fucking everything up? I'm sick of it! So, leave! I can't leave you. - So I'll go. - You're going nowhere! - Get off. - You're going nowhere, understand? - My foot! - What? It hurts. Get off me. Give me your money. Let go of my foot first. Is that all? Stay here till I get back. - Fuck you! - Got that? Happy birthday, big brother! Thank you. Welcome to our hotel. What'll you have? Souvlaki. My vase! This is for you. Thanks. Shampoo. Soap to get washed. A lamp. And loudspeakers for my birthday. Did you have enough money? Yes. No way. Where did you get the money? None of your business. What did you do all this time? Shopping. It's my birthday. I do what I want! Come on, rinse me off! - You're fine. - Any soap on me? No, nothing. Stop it! What a shit-hot view! Yeah, great! Stop drinking. It's my birthday. I do what I want. So… when we get the money from \"The Unspeakable\", I'll send 5,000 to Grandma Alma and with the rest, I'll go to America. Hold your horses, Di Caprio! Forget America. Why? We'll have Greek nationality and a passport. Yes, but you might get caught and end up in jail. And you're a minor. I won't let you go. We'll share the money when you're 18. Then, do what you like. What'll you do with the money? First I'll go to Crete. I won't go back there. Then, I'll buy this hotel and fix it up. You'll never have enough money. Then I'll rent it. I'll make it a fuckin' great hotel and I'll live in it. What a genius! To Xenia. It's \"Xen-í-a\", ignoramus. Shit! \"Rumore\"?! Where did you find it? - Carry on dancing! - You can't! Do you miss Jenny? Yes. You should do the audition. No way. I can't sing. You have more talent. You're more sexy, more… … gay. C'mon, let's go in. Jeez! Jeez, \"Rumore\"! Is it really you? Yes. But you're not real? Does it matter? No. You've grown big! Enormous! You've grown big, too. Since yesterday? Ody turned 18 today. I know. You look bigger, too. We killed you. What's it like? What? Being killed. It hurts. I'm sorry. I miss you. I have to go. It'll be daylight soon. Will you come back? 'Morning. Here… C'mon, get up! This early? Yes. - I had a bit too much to drink. - Yes. - Here. - OK! Hurry up, we're going to be late. Let's go! Give it more emotion! Think about your dream that's coming true… Right here and now. On \"Greek Star\"! Thanks. Take 10, then we'll film the trailer. Isn't that Maria? Don't go too far away! Hey. - Hey. - Come here. What're you doing here? Tassos sent me. He gave me this. Thanks. And I thought I might as well try my luck. Quite right. Come on, I'll show you. You go. I'll have a look around. - Stay nearby. - OK. Hello. I'm calling from the \"Fame\" press office. We have an invitation for Mrs Christopoulos for Jean Paul Gaultier's show tomorrow, here in Thessalonica. Can we give it to her in person? Yes, I'll hold. Just a second. Go ahead. Panorama… OK. Thanks a lot. Goodbye. Wow! The \"Fame\" offices are nice n' spacious! Fuck! Use this. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Should I wet my hair? - No… Give it here. Don't be scared. Bend down! Here for the audition? Not me. My brother. Get down lower. I'm singing \"Satisfaction\". Great. Stop it! Cut it out! You're ready. Neat! Thanks! You're welcome. - Are you from Thessalonica? - Crete. Really? - How did you get here? - Long story. You? I came from Serres yesterday. No brother. Stefanos. Dany. Hi. What was that shit on the phone? None of your business! Whatever. I must've missed my turn. - Let's go! - Where? Come on! Wait. They'll let me go on in a minute. Wait for me? I dunno. I've got things to do. Jean Paul Gaultier? Tonight I'll be going to the Alexandra. You'd like it. It's on the beach. Will you come? Promise? OK. Good luck! - You say \"Break a leg\". - Break a leg! What number? 35. Are you nervous? Not very. Tassos told me to wear this so I won't look cheap. Think I look cheap? No. Well? Do you like it? So-so. You're right, forget it. You're very pretty. Yeah, sure… Look at me. You are. Are you going like that? Yeah. Don't you like it? I do. You look a nice boy. I am a nice boy. I'm sure you'll win. You too. I don't really care. I'd like to go away. Go away? Where? Back to Ukraine? No. I can't go back anymore. To Europe. I hear Germany's good. It's hard to go there with my papers. For me, too. Do you want to go to Albania? Yes. Out of curiosity. But I'd be even more of a stranger there. Well, we're strangers everywhere. We're at home everywhere, too. Who is it? A delivery. For Mrs Christopoulos. \"Fame\" press office. Thank you. What do you want? I'm calling the police! Don't be scared, I wanted to meet you. I want to see your husband. What for? To get acquainted. Your husband, Lefteris Christopoulos, is my father. My biological father. I'm here on business, so I wanted to see him. Mom, can we go play downstairs? Hi! I'm Dany. What's her name? Go watch a DVD. Now! - Why? - Because. Run along! It's shit-hot here! Where are you going? Wait. Wait! I said, wait! Come here. Listen, you're making a mistake. No, I'm not. Your husband is my father and I came to meet him, OK? Either he didn't tell you he had other kids or you're playing dumb. What's your name? He's not the one you think! What's your name? Vivi… Vassiliki. Vivi or Vassiliki? I tell you, my husband isn't the one you're looking for! We got married 6 years ago. He wasn't married before that! If he had been, I wouldn't be here! At the time, he had a different name. He met my mother, Jenny when she came from Albania in '92. Who? Jenny, my mother! She's Albanian? No, Congolese! She attended Tirana music academy to be a singer. He offered to help her and sent her to a sleazy nightclub. The idiot fell in love with him. He gave her 2 kids and made her turn tricks. One fine day, he disappeared into thin air! We never saw him again. Really? You're wrong. It's not him! Go away! - I'm going nowhere! - Leave! Call him and ask him! Call him! Yes, Lefteris… No… not really. There's a young man here. An Albanian. He says he's your son. I don't know! In the house. Yes, he's here. Please. Now. He's coming. Great. - That's the pool? - It's not working. Pity. Mom, can we play downstairs? No, you go watch your cartoon. We'll be eating soon. OK. Mrs Vivi, do you have anything for me? I haven't eaten since this morning. Got any eggs? Now? OK, we're coming. - Are you number 1053? - Yes. - You're on next. - We're due tomorrow. We've speeded things up. Are you coming? - Yes. - Come on. It'll be fine. How old are you? 16… 15 and 9 and a half months. And you live here? Not here. I lived in Crete. Now I don't know. You're a real Albanian? No, 'cause my father's Greek. Thanks to him, I can get a Greek passport. Vivi! Your father's here. Come on. Go on! What happened? He came in and made a scene. You let him in? Yes. He said he had a delivery. - Where is he? - In the kitchen. - What's he doing? - Eating. - Eating what? - Eggs. - You made him eggs? - Yes. - Tell him to come. - You tell him. Hey! Take the kids upstairs. They can stay here. The kids are going upstairs. Christos, Caterina, run upstairs! I'll be right with you. Do you know him? Calm down. I've never seen him before. I was 2 years old when you left. You've changed, too! - He says he's your son. - You know I only have 1 son! And 2 others in Crete! In Crete? What're you talking about? Go or I'll call the cops. Great! Call them. No kidding? Pick up the phone! Really? - What're you waiting for? - Out! - No, man. Call the cops. - Beat it! Get lost! Scram, you scumbag! Or there'll be trouble! Get up! Aren't you a wild one? Downstairs. I'm coming. In just a minute. I said, move! I'll see to the kids. Be quick, Mrs Vivi. You're the scumbag. I can see you! Come on… Drop the gun. Let's go outside. Talk man to man, not in front of the kids. The kids? No kidding! Sit down! Just what do you want? Sit on the chair. OK. I'm sitting down. Legal recognition and money, what you owe us. What I owe you? How much? 100,000? Oh, really? Listen, kid. What's your name? Natacha! You don't remember? Make an effort. Dany, short for Daniel. I put them in their room. OK, Dany. Let's start over. - Calm down. - I am calm. You come in, threaten my wife in front of my kids, wave a gun around, and say you want money. I'll give you money, but I'm not who you think I am. I'm not your father… There's been a mistake, see? Your mistake was making me! Sit down! Where's your mother? I'll call her and explain I'm not the one you're looking for. It's too late. She died 2 weeks ago. Who would know your father? Someone must. Him! Hello? Where are you, dammit? I'm on in 2 minutes! What? Already? They said… I'm on now. Maria wasn't chosen. They're idiots! I'm sick of it. Where are you? Come on. I can't. I'm far away. Far away? What the fuck! Number 1061? It's my turn. Screw it. I'm not going. Ody, calm down. Relax. Sing like Jenny taught you and it'll be fine. Think of her! Hurry up. Are you 1061? Let's go. It's me next. Bravo! Don't hang up, I want to hear you. It's not allowed. Make something up. Say your grandfather's sick. Please! Don't hang up. I want to hear it. Ody, do you hear me? OK, hang on. Hello. My name's Odysseas. - You're from Albania? - Yes. You have a very Greek name. Yes. I was born in Crete, I'm… You're what? Nothing. I'm a bit nervous. It's only natural. What're you going to sing? An Italian song from the 60s, \"Tutt'al più\". By Patty Pravo. How do you know her? Long story. You need your phone? It's for my brother. Phones aren't allowed. He's in Crete, he's sick. Very sick. It's thanks to him that I'm here. He coached me. OK, your brother can listen in. Go on. Shut up and listen! Bravo, it was great. You were amazing! Can you hear me? Clap! What? Odysseas, did your brother like it? Ask him. Is he still on the line? Hello? Can you hear me? Clap! OK, that's enough. Can you hear? Yeah. Did you like it? You nailed it, man! You sang better than Jenny. What does the jury say? Enough! What's going on? Hands up! I said, hands up! Mrs Vivi… Where are you? Who's Vivi? Everything's fine. - What was that? - Nothing. Everything's OK. Where are you? You went after him! Fuck, fuck, fuck! What did the jury say? We said we'd go together! Don't do anything stupid. I'm on my way! Where are you? Panorama. 35 Metaxa Street. Take a taxi, it's 10 euros. Who's coming? Your other son. Who? Mrs Vivi! Stop being so formal! It's getting on my nerves. Jenny taught us to be polite to older women. She hated familiarities. Especially with strangers. Got something sweet? What? Some candy. Toffee, chocolate, a lollipop… Super, my favorite! Can you unwrap it? Thank you. Take your jacket off. - What? - Your jacket. Take it off! Good. Your shirt, too. What? Take your shirt off! Why? Because I said so! Take it off. You shave? Mrs Vivi, does he shave? Ask who it is first! - Who is it? - Odysseas. Open up! Quick! Here. In the living room! The bastard shaves! I don't! You lied to me. You were going to get rid of it. Give me the gun. No, he'll kill us! Give! He says it's not him. It is him, isn't it? He's not the one who cradled you. What? Tassos did. \"The Unspeakable\" didn't give a damn! You seem like a reasonable guy. Your brother fired the gun. We nearly had carnage! It's not my fault. He tried to kill me! Let's get this over with! Your brother's sick. He's not well! What? He talks crazy nonsense. What nonsense? That I'm your father. Aren't you? It's him, Ody! It's him! No, it's not true. What if it was you? What if it was me, what? This is insane! What if it was you? Look at me! Do you remember me? Do you remember me? Tell him, Ody! Do you remember me? What? Do you remember me? You're crazy, too! Fuck… I'll give you the cash I have here. It's in the drawer. He gave her a look! Lefteris, not again! Enough! Get off my brother! Leave him alone! Get off him. Get off him! Fuck you! Are you OK? It's just a scratch. I'll bring some alcohol from the kitchen. Go on, speak! Say what? That morning, I asked you why you were packing your case. You said: \"Quiet. Don't wake the others.\" You took the money from the kitchen drawer. You said you'd be back later, with gifts. Is that the truth or not? I made you promise. And you promised me. Is that true or not? Is it? Because I waited for you. Speak, you fucker! Speak! Get it over with! Speak! Say yes. Yes! Why didn't you come back? That's enough. It's over. It's over, do you understand? Right… I'll give you all our cash. Then, you go, OK? And tomorrow, you'll get the rest. Recognition papers, DNA test… I don't want your recognition. Nor do I. I don't want to see you again, fascist pig! Enough! Just go. My bag. Now go! Thanks, Dad! It's a hell of a place! Goodbye, Mrs Vivi. Kiss the kids from us. Before you came, I wasn't sure it was him. What're you doing? Stop it. Enough. It was him, right? Maybe. - Was it or wasn't it? - Who cares? He was a jerk anyway! There's not a single taxi around here. And no kiosk, either. I wouldn't live here if you paid me. - Maria's waiting for me. - Call her, dummy! Everything's OK… Where are you? We'll be there in 20 minutes. Bye. I'm not going with you. Why not? Something to do. So, did they pick you or not? I don't think so, seeing as I ran off. But I did good, didn't I? Are you kidding? You fucking nailed it! Next month, there are auditions for \"Greece Has Got Talent\". We'll take part. Isn't that a kiosk? Where? Come on! The last one is a rotten egg! - 1st! - 2nd! Thanks. Riccardo. As well as the cigarettes, please get some mint chewing gum. Thanks. Ciao, amore! - See that? - What? Shit! - Run! - Where? Fuck! What came over you? Didn't you see her? Who? In the car! Who was it? It was Patty Pravo! No kidding? I swear! Yeah, sure! She even spoke to me. - Patty Pravo? - Yes! What did she say? She said: \"Ciao.\" \"Ciao\" … something. Goddess! Oh, Dany, you'll never grow up! Always imagining things! A film by Panos H.

{"title": "Xena: Warrior Princess - A Friend in Need (The Director's Cut) (2002) - full transcript", "plot": "A director's cut version of the final two episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess.", "content": "In the time of ancient gods, warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero. She was Xena, a mighty princess forged in the heat of battle. The power. The passion. The danger. Her courage will change the world. XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS Looking out at the cosmos makes you think... about where we are..., where we've been..., where we're going now. Yeah. And like the bigger now. I mean, Gabrielle, what are we gonna do? Wander around Greece our whole lives looking for trouble? Why don't we go away? Far away? Whaddya say? I can't believe you're awake, much less listening to me. Let's go south, to the land of the pharaohs. I hear they're in need of a girl with a chakram. You know that there's somebody out there. Yeah, he's been trying to find us the past half-hour. Are you all right? Oh. Yes. Thank you. Whoa! Are you Xena? Who's askin'? A messenger, sent by Akemi. Akemi? You saw Akemi? Several weeks ago..., I was journeying with another monk through a forest, near the town of Higuchi. It started to rain..., and we sought shelter at a teahouse. Kenji..., not even you could be frightened of this. Your shuji has great dignity and beauty. I am blessed with a certainty... about what it means to be a monk. But my companion... was not as steadfast in his resolve. You must leave... now. Come on! What?! I know you're a good man. In the teahose, I felt the compassion in your heart. Don't fear me. Who-Who... Who was that demon?! The Lord of the Dark Land. He's preparing an army to wage war in Higuchi... and slowly, the populace. Honorable monk..., I beg you to do what must be done: to stop him enslaving the souls of that city. But I'm no swordsman! There's one in the west... far beyond the setting sun. A samurai?! A priest?! A god?! No. A warrior princess. Xena, you must save Higuchi from destruction. The Land of the Rising Sun. That's beyond Chin[a]. I didn't know you were there, Xena. Yes, I was there. I was there. Gabrielle, this is not going to be the trip that I promised you..., but if Akemi calls, I must go. Wherever you go, I'm by your side. I knew you'd say that. The way of the sword... is the most ancient of the warrior's art. With practice, the samurai develops the sacred virtues of bravery..., self-discipline, and honor. A samurai would rather die a warrior than live as a coward. This Akemi who sent for Xena..., what do you know about her? She was forced by Yodoshi..., the Lord of the Dark Land..., to seduce souls... into his grasp. She's very beautiful. - And she's a ghost. - She's a...? Gabrielle, before we reach Japa..., I should tell you everything that happened there last time. Many years ago..., Borias told me about a young girl who was kidnapped by a Chinese warlord. She'd been taken hostage from a mighty island... even further east than Chin[a]. Being the kind of person I was then..., the challenge of finding a new land to plunder was just too much for me. I had to meet her. So, her daddy's rich, you say? And powerful. He should pay well for the return of his sweet daughter. Come. - Akemi, meet... - ...Xena, the Warrior Princess. You know me? Oh, yes. I've heard that you're afraid of nothing. Kao, here..., - he's afraid of many things. - This girl has spirit. This girl deserves to die..., speaking like that in front of my guests. You won't kill me. Xena won't let you. Because in her heart... she knows that she will soon love me. Xena loves no one. I'll be your student, Xena. You'll take me with you. You'll teach me everything you know. I have a few lessons for you! Here. Fifty pieces of gold. It's the best offer you'll get for her. I do what I want with my property. I say this isn't a good day to trade. Is it a good day to die? It's unhealthy to negotiate with this one. I'd take the gold. Guards! I've shut off the flow of blood to your brain. You got ten, nine, eight... Ah, forget it. I would have taken the gold. You know, Borias, I have a dream..., a dream of conquering every land between here and Brittania. Xena, you're always looking for green pastures to rape and pillage. Yep. And maybe there's more in this than just the ransom, huh? I mean, with her father as an ally, I could get a nice toehold on that island. What makes you so sure she'll lead you to daddy? Ah, she wouldn't lie to me. Hmm. She worships her teacher. What's so funny? Xena, you couldn't teach a dog to bark. Akemi! Come here, I wanna show you something. You're wrong. Xena will be a great teacher. I'm ready. All right. If someone's comin' atcha with a right/left combination..., this is what I wantcha to do. You feint back, twist in the direction of the blow, and then deliver a vicious jumping, spinning back-kick. All right? Right. So..., that's right, a left, a feint, uh, a jumping, swinging... Jumping, spinning back-kick. All right. Now, I'll be a bad guy. Hmm. Lesson One: trust no one. Remember, Xena, I get 10% of the ransom. Good luck, teacher. Come on, Akemi, keep up. My ribs are still a little sore. Well, next time we'll start with something a little simpler. Like listening. Listen to that. To what? To life and death. Every sound, every movement is a message. A wagon just crossed a creek up ahead. A deer grazing nearby. When you listen to the Kami like that..., you must be at peace. The Kami? What's that? The Kami are the powers behind all nature. They make the sun shine, the grass grow. They brought you to me. No, no, no. When I listen like that, I'm at war. Every sound is a possible warning of an enemy approaching. I believe that one day, Xena..., the Kami will help you know peace. And I would be honored... if you would accept this. Oh. Uh... It's really pretty. It's our scripts. When my people are overcome with a feeling that needs to be preserved..., we write verse. Oh, yeah? - Like what feeling? - Love. Love? \"Yesterday..., the moon took lodging on my sleeve. Today..., I've hope for even the brokenhearted stars.\" So beautiful. To write something like that, she must have loved you very much. What's wrong? The truth is, Gabrielle..., she broke my heart. She broke your heart? I don't understand. For a while, I didn't understand myself. When I travelled with Akemi to her island for the ransom..., I was to learn that my heart was seeking something else. I thought I was taking you to your father. His castle's in the north. We came here first to visit my grandfather. He... died here... many years ago. Are you telling me that we've walked days in the wrong direction to see a dead guy?! We must visit my grandfather to seek his blessing. He's dead..., but... I can still speak to him. All your talk about moons up your sleeve..., you were playing me for a fool. I oughtta just...! You hear the Kami through the sounds of nature. In the same way, I hear sounds that are silent to you. My grandfather says that you are a wise and appropriate teacher. And... he feels your sword... is not good enough. There's a string of widows from here to Greece that say different. Compared to a katana... all other swords are toys. Well..., then get me one of those. The Great Katana lies near here. But... you must know. In our country... women are forbidden to own katana. Well, they're just gonna have to get used to it, aren't they? Sensei! I come bearing a challenge. My master wishes to fight you for possession of the Katana..., forged from the purest ore of the Hakiman temple. Your master must be a mighty samurai. Oh, no. I'm just a girl... in search of a really good sword. A woman? A foreigner?! Challenging us? For the sacred katana?! This is a great insolence! Well, I guess you're gonna have to teach me a lesson, hmm? Ooh, gimme, gimme! Yeah. Grandpa was right. Now, this is a sword. \"In a flurry of snow, two breaths of wind unite... and become as one..., and then disappear into each other.\" Listen, Akemi..., I don't want you to take this the wrong way. I really love this sword..., and you're a nice kid, but I just came for the ransom. I don't believe that. What do you hear now? Snow falling on cedars. No. Your heart... beating harder than normal. You're a master of war..., yet... you know no words to speak of love. And then you go and save my life. There's no greater gift of love a teacher can give a student than that. I have another gift I must ask of you. I saw what you did to kill that coward, Kao. It's a sacred trust. I would be honored, beyond words..., if you'd teach me that. All right. You knew her for a few weeks and you taught her the pinch? - Xena, in all the time... - Higuchi is under siege, and there's no place to dock. I'm turning back. What?! Gabrielle, I've got to go ashore. I'm with you. I knew you'd say that. The katana! You sent it to the foreign whore! Thank you. She's traveling to the city of Higuchi..., which my army right now... is destroying. My general awaits her..., and when he captures Xena and my katana..., she'll lose her head... to the sting of its blade. So, thank you..., daughter. Firebombs! They're going to burn Higuchi to the ground. We've gotta release the water from the tower. Gabrielle, what would you do? I saw these acrobats. - They used to... - Show me, Gabrielle. Climb on! All right. What's next? This way! Gabrielle! Whoa! Xena! Go for the ladder! Kill her! Retreat! A wise general knows when a fight is lost..., but I think we will meet again... soon. Whoohoo! We've won! We've won! Move! Move! We've won! We've won! Move! Move! This way! Follow me! Higuchi is saved. Not quite the way I would have done it, Gabrielle, but it sure worked. You know, Xena, I still don't understand. You taught Akemi the pinch. Did she ever use it? Yes, unfortunately she did. After a many days' walk, we reached her father's fortress. Akemi? Akemi, what are you doing? You've thirty seconds to live. My brothers..., my sisters..., my mother..., and my gentle grandparents. I avenge all your deaths... at the hands of this monster. - Father. - Father? I pray you suffer in death... the way your family suffered in life. What the hell did you do that for? It was my duty. He had to die. I don't care about that! What about the ransom?! Where's my money?! Forgive me, Xena. I don't suppose there's any inheritance in this! I have one last thing to ask of you. Restore my honor. The sacred katana. You want me to cut off...? That's why you wanted me to take the katana. After that is done..., take my ashes... and place them in the family shrine..., in the town of Higuchi. No, no. No, I'm not going to...! Akemi. I pray you will. \"The... snow melts. Flowers fade. And I pass... as all things do.\" You... \"But-But time... and love..., they go on.\" Restore my honor, Xena. Xena! How will you feel when you come face-to-face with Akemi's ghost? Better question is..., how will Xena feel... face-to-face... with the ghosts of the people she killed at Higuchi?! What?! Who are you? My family name is... Harukata. But he's known as the killer of ghosts. - Xena saved your city. - This time. But that does nothing to atone... for what happened... when last she was here! What's he talking about? I was fulfilling Akemi's dying wish: to place her ashes at the family shrine here in Higuchi. Word got out that I was honoring the ashes of a girl who'd killed her father. The townsfolk felt that I would be defiling their graveyard. They banded together to stop me. Xena. Bitch! Bitch! Go home, bitch! Go home, bitch! Go away! She killed her father! Go! Go! Go! Get out! Get out! - Get out! - Get out! Kill her! I tried to ignore them, but they came after me. Xena! Akemi! Akemi! Akemi! Watch out! Run! Run; fire! Fire! The wind took the fire... from house to house. 40.000 of my townsfolk... perished... in the flames! No, it's not possible. That is... only the beginning! Akemi told me that after she killed her father, Yodoshi's spirit was so full of evil, even the underworld would not allow him to enter. He became Lord Yodoshi..., the eater of souls. Now he holds them... inside him..., enslaved. If that is true..., then I am guilty of a greater evil than I ever thought possible. Xena, it was a horrible accident. No. No, I must put things right. Can you hear them? I thought I heard a horse before. Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. How many are there? At least three armies are gathering. The general we met at the water tower was right. We will meet again and soon. I'll warn the others. Ghost killer..., I know that you think of me as your enemy..., but you must believe this: my spirit aches for the torment I've caused. We both want... the same thing: to release those souls. You've devoted your life to killing Yodoshi. Why is it that you have never succeeded? I have the power... to slay him. But it is impossible for me to get close enough... to use my blade. Why? Because... I am mortal. Only... another ghost... can trap... a spirit as mighty as Yodoshi. Akemi..., I know what I must do. But I'm afraid that this day... what's done may not be undone. Xena, the militia is prepared. Why aren't you ready? Gabrielle, come here. Come here, give me your hands. All right. Here. Feel the surge of blood under the skin. - Now, just behind... - Xena. You don't have to do this. I understand why you would never wanna teach me the pinch. No. No, today more than ever... I want you to know what I know. Please. Why are you doing this? Gabrielle..., if I only had thirty seconds to live... this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Stop this. Stop it. Always remember: I love you. Why would you teach me this right now? I don't understand! There's nothing to understand. I just wanted you to know everything I know. Are you ready? Let's go, we got a battle to win. Wouldn't it be better if we stayed with Xena? Xena wants us to lead a contingent to the east plain. She said a group of Yodoshi's archers are gathering there. It's too quiet out here. Gabrielle, what would you do? (what would you do?) Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. (what's behind the sounds.) Always remember: I love you. (I love you. [...]) Xena! (Xena!) Xena! All right. Now you asked for it. Gabrielle! If I only had thirty seconds to live... We're going to be together. You brought out the best in me. Gabrielle! ...this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Xena! You came to me in my dreams... and I thought it was reality. Now you come to me in reality... and it feels like it's a dream. Either way, I'm filled with joy. The ghost killer. What's he doing? His job. Speeding wandering souls on their way, before they can be devoured by Yodoshi. Perhaps he sees Xena. Xena is alive! Do you understand? She is alive. I want to write a verse to express how I feel..., but there's no poetry of sufficient beauty. Akemi..., I've been in the underworld before, but it never felt like this. What's goin' on? Our bodies..., they're an illusion... projected by Yodoshi. While we are under his power... we must obey his will. Funny, you're just the way I remember you. I am at your service, Lord Yodoshi. You most certainly are. An eternity... of playing the whore to service my appetite for souls. Xena..., I was so worried that you wouldn't show Yodoshi respect. He's very dangerous. It wasn't respect I was showing him. I have a job to do. The job that you called me for. I'm going to destroy Yodoshi. It will be very dangerous. He seems to grow mightier with each passing day. You're going to have to trust me, Akemi. There's someone I have to meet... that can help us. You know you are being watched. Akemi, I can still hear your heart beating. And I can hear every one of Myuki's clumsy footfalls. She'll try to follow me. Let her. Shh. I saw something. The samurai may have Xena captive. We'll split up. - Xena. - Gabrielle. What are you doing here? I was so worried about you. I found your chakram. There's so much blood. I'm all right. What's with the robes? Gabrielle, I'm going to kill the Lord of the Dark Land. You'll need this. I can't take that. It's difficult to explain. You're dead. How could you let yourself be killed? I'm sorry, Gabrielle, I couldn't tell you. You'd have tried to stop me, and then we'd both be dead. Is that supposed to make me feel better? We've overcome death before. We will find a way to bring me back. But only by becoming a spirit can I kill Yodoshi and free those souls that I condemned to torment. Don't you see that? You're my whole life, Xena. I won't lose you. You won't lose me. Harukata, don't you come near her. Put down your weapons, Gabrielle. He's working with me. The anklet! With this, we can bring Yodoshi to us when we're ready. This is my soul mate. She's a poet like you, Akemi. I have one question. Would you risk your life... for the return of hers? Without hesitation. There is a way, Gabrielle. You must take her body, burn it..., then sprinkle the ashes into the Fountain of Strength on Mount Fuji. You must find the fountain before the second sunset after death. That's tomorrow. Harukata will say the incantations necessary... to give the sacred katana power against malicious spirits. Gabrielle. This is Akemi. It is an honor to meet you at last. And you, Akemi. Gabrielle can't help with our work in the tea house. She knows what she must do, and she should leave soon. Thank you. Wait. I would like to give you something... to protect you on your journey. Good luck, old friend. I am getting your body back, Xena, no matter where they have hidden it. Before sunset tomorrow, we will meet again... on the side of Mount Fujisan. See you there. Give me her head! I've been expecting you. Your friend was a fine opponent. She provided me with one of the greatest trophies an honorable samurai could ever claim. You call yourself honorable? You outnumbered her a thousand to one. You're not a samurai, you're a fraud. You couldn't've killed Xena unless she wanted you to. I think it's you with a death wish! I accept the challenge. Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. (behind the sounds.) It was the greatest honor of my life... to send Xena to an early grave. If I cannot do the same to you..., then I ask you... to grant me a noble defeat. Please, remove my head in one stroke. Good. Huh? Where is Miyuki?! Where is he? Duck! We finally meet, ghost killer. Akemi. Akemi. Akemi. Are you all right? Harukata, what went wrong? There is... only one explanation. He's drinking... from the Fountain of Strength on Mount Fuji. If you drink... from the fountain... and use... the sword I blessed..., it will be the final destruction... for any spirit. Xena..., my soul... will soon join the others..., trapped in... Yodoshi's grasp. You must finish a job... and release us all. I will not rest till it is done. I can't let you die. If I only had thirty seconds to live... this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Even in death, Gabrielle..., I will never leave you. You will return to me, my friend. Yodoshi a hawk? Even with his injuries, in bird form, he could make Fujisan in half a day. Yes, but he's weakened. We're no longer confined to these physical illusions. We could change into other vessels. What about them? Yes. Good. Xena. Gabrielle... is on her way to Mount Fujisan. And... if she succeeds... She'll succeed, don't worry. She's very good at what she does. I'm so sorry. Akemi..., what's wrong? I have to tell you... what must be done... to save those souls..., but I feel my own soul is doomed... for what I'm about to tell you. I know that you did what you thought you had to, Akemi. And perhaps by releasing those souls..., we'll all be redeemed. Come on. You'll come to regret not allowing me a warrior's death. It's not too late to put that right! I will not allow you to find the fountain... and revive your friend. No! No! No! Come on. Come on! What? My own daughter?! Akemi! Xena? Xena? Xena. Xena..., what happened? Told you I'd see you here. The Fountain of Strength... Get water... Fountain... Water... Gabrielle... Gabrielle, I need the sacred katana to finish the job. Thank you. The sun is setting, Xena. I have to find your ashes. - Gabrielle... - Come on! Gab... Enough of this! You are about to join the 40.000 souls you condemned, Xena. And the first thing I'll do... is take the head off your little friend with the tatoo. You won't live that long. I deserve the dignity of a warrior. Dignity, huh? Like you showed my friend? - Xena. - Akemi. You've redeemed me. You've redeemed them! - You've redeemed yourself! - Go in peace, Akemi. We'll meet again... one day. - No, Gabrielle. - Xena. - No. - Xena..., the sun is setting. - I have to bring you back to life. - No. Not if it means condemning the souls of the 40.000 who burned at Higuchi. - The souls are free. - They're free from Yodoshi's grasp. Akemi didn't wanna tell me this in case I wouldn't come back to help..., but for those souls to be released into a state of grace..., they must be avenged. I must stay dead. - But if I bring you back to life... - Those souls will be lost forever. Xena... That is not right. I don't care. - You're all that matters to me. - Don't you know how much I wanna let you do this? But if there is a reason for our travels together..., it's because I had to learn from you... enough to know the final, the good, the right thing to do. I can't come back. I can't. I love you, Xena. How am I supposed to go on without you? I'll always be with you, Gabrielle. Always. Xena. A life of journeying has brought you to the farthest lands..., to the very edges of the Earth. And to the place where I'll always remain: your heart. - So, where to now? - I think we should go south, to the land of the pharaohs. I hear they need a girl with a chakram. Where you go..., I'm at your side.

Do you need a hand with that? Thank you. Mae, what should we do? - I think... - Oh, shhh. Let me decide. Mae... Mae... Mae... Do you want to see my tongue inside of you? Yes, please. Are you ready for the next photo? - Do you like Mae much in this? - Yeah. I want you to fuck both of us. Mae, would you like that? THE LOGISTICS OF DOMESTIC SERVITUDE EXCITE ME.

I'm supposed to be cleaning today. It's still my time here. Alright, ok. It's just I was told to come here and clean today and I had to come from all the way across town, so...

And we're trying to... decided to fool around on the bed And I thought to myself, \"Oh, man. How fun it would be if I'd put my phone up his ass.\" And I did! And it fit perfectly. But then, when we tried to get it out, it was stuck. No matter what we did, we just couldn't get it out. We were just stuck there, looking at each other we don't know what to do with my phone up his ass. We had no insurance, no money. So we decided to each... Shut the fuck up and eat my pussy! Good boy. Looks like you missed the spot. There was this time when my boyfriend and I attended a summer wedding by the Mediterranean Sea. We ended up fighting and I remember feeling this longing to be next to the water, to find solace in the magical light of dawn. I wanted to reconnect with myself and to the sensuality of nature. I fantasized that somehow on that shore my desires would come true... by TheLittleMermaid WET (“spinning around like a lingonberry in vagina”) in an old Finnish saying, describes today those who cannot stay still and are always doing too many things at the same time.

The day is past, and yet I saw no sun. And now I live, and now my life is done. My tale was heard and yet it was not told, my honor clear, yet my hands unclean. My youth is spent and yet I am not old. I saw the world and yet I was not seen. My thread is cut and yet it is not spun. And now I live and now my life is done. I sought my death and found it in the womb. I looked for life and found it was a shade. I trod the earth and knew it was my tomb. And now I die, and now I was but made.

Too bad you're not that interesting. So what would make you more interested, then? Cat got your tongue? How are you doing, bud? I know school is not fun, but we all gotta do it. It's not that. What's wrong? They won't work. They won't work, Tie. Why won't they work? Am I dying? No, Luke... You're not dying. You're just a little sick. I promise I'll take care of you. Got that? I'll do whatever it takes. Mom and I already have a plan to fix everything. You know that, right? No matter what it is, I'll take care of you. Good let's get those shoes on. I got to get you a new pair. Supergirl was it? No, Superman, but Supergirl can be cool too, right? Dude, you got to stop listening to Jocelyn Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Okay. I need you to do a big favor for me. Can you be like Superman today for Mom? She's talking to the doctor right now how to get that kryptonite out of you. Can you do that for me? Good. Remember what Dad used to always say? He said being a hero comes from here. But let's be real. Superpowers can't hurt. You know, these were Dad's. Want to know what he told me about them? Whoever wore them is granted the powers of a superhero for a whole day. Nu-uh. It's okay if you don't believe me. It's still true. I don't believe you. I gotta go, little Frost. Remember, Sunday is our day, so plan something fun. Hey? Love you, Little Frost. I think we're all set. I still can't believe he would do that. We almost lost him, Joce. I'm sorry. I can't imagine finding him like that. I know it's been hard on you. I mean, who knows what he was thinking in that moment? Ya know, his mom was gone. We had great fathers, Tie, honorable men. Who knows where we would be if our fathers were anything like that horrible man. I don't know. Do you want to talk about it? No. Okay. So I was talking to your mom and she said that you're taking a pass on college? Joce, I don't want to talk about it. No. Tie, I think it's very honorable. Your dad would be proud. That's not it. What? I'm not going to college, and I'm not joining the military either. That's not funny. Tell me you're joking. You can't understand, Joce. Try me. Your family is well off. Titus, they're not paying for my school. You can get scholarships, loans if you have to. I know your grades weren't terrible. It's not that, okay? You just can't understand, Joce. Just let it go. Yeah, let it go, just like your future plans to make something of yourself. I'll be right out. Mom. I know. I thought we were in the clear. He really has this. He's so young. How could this happen? It's okay, Mom. The doctor said that it's treatable. I start work next week. We'll make enough. I know, Tie. I know. You better hurry up. They're waiting for you. Titus. Lucian couldn't have asked for a better brother, so thank you. All right. You guys ready? Yeah. Some of us are. Joce, can we not? Titus, this isn't a game. You need to wake up. You need to think about what you're doing. Can you guys stop fighting, please? Dude. Yeah. I'm sorry, Sonny. It's fine. It's just the shrinks kept trying to tell me that arguing can be healthy, but it just brings me back to a dark place when Bill used to- - I'm sorry, but at least he's gone, right? Nah. He's out there, somewhere. So... Check this out. You guys are going to love it Should we take them now? Shut your mouth. I've told you time and again not to speak unless you're told! Bane of my existence, you are. Sorry, Master. Captain, you were right. I saw the boy's mark with my own eyes. They're leaving now. The car is bugged. Excellent. Destination is obvious. Want us to follow just in case? Yes. It shall be done, Captain. Head out to the hills. Although, an expeditious stopover might be in order. I see dinner. Why do you cry? You were worthless, yet I've made you special. Can you not fathom the beauty you've created? Look. Look! Please, kill me. Why? It hurts so much. No. Pain does not warrant death. Back in your box. How much time does this one have left? A day or two before her painting is complete. Perfect. I'm nearly out of test subjects. Yes. A human cannot grasp the purpose of death. Perfect. Husband, what is this about? There is a boy who wears the mark. My dear, why must you do this, forfeit all that we've created? This is a mistake. What will become of me, of our children? Silence. Cain, do you not love me? Unacceptable. You dare question me? There will be no interference from you this time, Lillith. To forget who I am would be extremely unwise. No. I will go this time, Wife. Stop by the campground or stop by the falls first? Isn't the campground like six miles in? I'm not hiking in the dark. Don't worry. As men, we'll protect you. Get back here! Left the girl for you. Much obliged. Poor lass. Even your streets are no longer safe. You've got some fight in you. I like that. Oh, I wouldn't want to end up like him, would we? You're free to go. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Run. Thanks for the fire, Joce. Of course. Someone had to do it. Yeah. Good call. I know. Well, I'm going to go use the lake facilities. Ew. See? Lake water. Same things go on in the ocean, Joce. Titus, why aren't you doing anything with your future? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? You can't understand. Well, explain it to me. All right. Fine. You want to know why? Obviously. All right. Sit down. I don't want to. Whatever. Luke has got ALS, all right? Oh my god. Oh my god. The only way we'll have enough money is if I start working, now. You know, I'd love to go to school or join the military, but right now, my brother needs me. Do you even know what it's like, to have somebody you love dying right before you? Just this morning... He can't even tie his shoes, Joce, and this is just the beginning. It's not fair. Ah. You guys ready? What happened? Help me! Please! Please, oh my god, please! - Please, oh my god, please! - What's going on? Please, oh my god, please! - They're coming! - Who? - Who's coming? - Help me! Vampires! - What? - Oh my gosh. - Please, help me! - Hey, hey. - That's not... Stop... Stop- - JOCELYN: You people and- They're right there! Uh, guys. Would you like to know the purpose of a shadow? Shadows are a glimpse into the truths of the human heart, constructed to protect, yet never allowing for its carnal embrace. This is so stupid. I'm leaving. You're not funny. Without our shadows, the darkness would be set free. Once it's free, it slowly consumes all in its path till there's only one choice. Let's go! Let's go! Hurry! Come on, Sonny! Go, go, go, go! You cannot escape the dark. What is this place? I don't know, some abandoned factory or something. Why? You scared? Shut up. Crap. There's no service out here. Me too. Well... I'm not going back that way. Let's hide in here for the night. Damn. Okay. What the hell just happened? I don't know, but I'm about to find out. What website are you from?! - Joce. - What? Maybe she's telling the truth. No. Vampires aren't real. Maybe not. You got to admit, that guy- - What do I do? - What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Crap! You all right, man? This isn't my bag. Ah! I must've grabbed the wrong one! Hey, dude, relax. I'm not crazy. Sonny, you grabbed my bag, so I grabbed yours. Have I ever let you down? I knew it. I knew I was right. I'll tell you guys something. They're not going to hurt anyone I care about ever again! Nobody! Dude, you're such a badass right now! Sonny, are you okay? You know this doesn't mean anything. Someone is just trying to scare us. That's all. Joce, I'm not losing it. I haven't felt this clear in a long time. I just want to keep us safe. Do you trust me? Of course! We both do. Good, now look. There's some important stuff in my bag that's going to help us fight these guys. See for yourself. A crucifix? And salt? But no matches? Why so much salt? It's more for ghosts, which can't hurt here. It's about preservation and purity. Just pour some unbroken lines across the perimeter. You know you're not going to win any awards as an actress? I'm on to you. You, you're going to answer some questions for me, but first, show me your teeth. You don't seem to be a vampire. How do you know the ones chasing you were? Did they drink blood? Did they have aversion to light? Did you ever see one turn? Well? They took me and my brother! They... They made him drink blood, and then, they killed him. And when he came back, he tried to kill me. They kept me in a box. They cut me and used my blood to paint. Please, make it stop. Make it stop. Do you remember his name? Was it Bill Cameron? I... I don't remember. It's fine. What's your name? Gentry. Gentry. That's a beautiful name. You've got us now. Don't worry. That's my boy, all grown up. Sonny is just being nice. Hey, Tie, I don't know what's going on here. Hey. I just want you to know how sorry I am. I was such a jerk, and- - I know. Thinking you were blowing off your future. I should have known that something was up, and I am so sorry about Luke. I know. Tie. He's so young. I keep saying how sorry I am, but I really am. If you need anything... I love you, Joce. What did you say? Sonny: Guys, there's something out there! You cannot escape the dark. Titus! Enough. You should not have run. Enjoy yourselves. Titus! How's my acting now, bitch? Hey, Sonny, I do know a Bill. Gentry! Get back here! Gentry! Probably not the time to tell you your salt wasn't worth a damn! They're vampires, not ghosts! I'll kill you! Sonny! You're mine! I'll be back for you. You're not going to be pretty when we're done with you. There's nowhere to run. I knocked a lamp over, so the floor is covered in propane. I smell nothing. I will burn this place to the ground. What is that? Go. What the hell? Who are you? Girl, did you do this? Hey, I'm talking to you. I said, \"Answer me!\" You're in my way, child. Too bad. Listen to me! She is mine! Now! That slut is mine! Answer me! Jasper. Rosalie. What? We don't know you, right? Rosalie? We most certainly do not. Explain yourself. My master is your god. No. I am your god. - No. I am your god. - No. I am your god.- Hey! You ain't my god! No. I am your god. Hey! You ain't my god! Are you going to kill us, too? No. Now get out of my way. What do you want? You can't understand. No. He's done nothing to you. Leave him alone. No. Just leave him alone! You will fall asleep now. He .. will... die... if... you... don't- I know. Why should I let you die? Answer my question. I don't know. To stop disappointing you? No, but you might be on the right chord. What can death provide that life cannot for someone in your position? Back in your box. Enter and speak. Patrol found her near the entrance. Long walk from the factory. Surprised she's alive. Leave her. You risked my apprentice, Husband? Use your spirit magic and view her memories. With pleasure. Your magic fascinates me, my dear. What happened? Such darkness. How is this possible? Explain. He's a child of yours. No. His presence is more kin than child. He is you, but more? Me but more. Intriguing. He killed them both so quickly. No matter. We're at the end. Do you have what we need? Of course. But what of this intruder? We can't dismiss his presence so quickly. He wants the boy. Shut up, human. His presence seems rather formidable. Perhaps he desires your master's power. No. I believe him to be a traveler. When you alter the boy's memories, make him see the intruder in my place. Certainly, my love. Free to leave, Jocelyn. Friend not dead. Are you talking? Yes. What is going on? What is this thing? What are you doing to him? Who are you? Where's Titus? I don't have time for this. Rude, Xane. I'm not thing, Jocelyn. How do you know my name? Watch her. Where are you going? That's none of your concern. Wait! Xane not good with people. Can't blame. Been 10,000 years. 10,000 years? What are you? From future. I'm... a... spirit almost... gone... now. Oh. What's wrong with you? Dying vessel holding life force. Damaged. Have hope now. Sonny! What's wrong with him? Is he going to be okay? Sonny is vampire now. What? This has got to be a nightmare. Why is he chained up? Newborn vampire. Dangerous. Precaution. Stop from attacking you. And the news just keeps getting better and better. Newborn attacking you good news? 10,000 years in the future and you're telling me sarcasm doesn't make it? That's it. I've officially lost it. Ah. Sarcasm. Ha ha ha. Xane not partake. Your buddy who stormed out of here? You don't say. Where's Titus? Is Mr. Personality coming back? Why didn't he kill us? So many questions. Xane right about you. Conserving strength. Goodbye. You've got to be kidding me. Hello, Mother. Hello, my dear. Lay down. Be still. Enough. You should not have run. Enjoy yourselves. Jocelyn? Sonny? Gentry? You will fall asleep now. When you awake, you'll remember all you've witnessed to be true. You will not be sad or cry or carry on. You will be strong, and angry. The memory should hold easily. Will that be all for today? - Will that be all for today? - Yes, Gentry. Will that be all for today? That will be all for today, probably for a while. Mother, are you not pleased? You care about my husband, love him as you love me. I would do anything for the both of you. Yes. I feel that. I'm going to tell you the truth. Your father longs for death. But he can't die. Unfortunately that's not true. If he's slain by a vampire of his lineage on the tetrad, he can die. This boy is of that lineage. How can you know? All of your father's lineage bear a mark, this mark. The blood moon happens in two days. For the past 1,000 years, I've sought out and eliminated all who bore the mark of Cain, and somehow this boy still exists. I've rightfully protected my husband from death two times, but he grows increasingly impatient with my interference. Admittedly, I fear what he'll do when he finds out I'm... Nevermind that. My child, if I can't change your father's mind before the night of the blood moon, you must run away with the boy. If the boy is the problem, let me slit his throat! I'll do it gladly! As pleasurable as that would be, your father is linked with him. He's practically immortal. Mother, take these. Use them! Use the knife and the ring! Use them to control Father until after the blood moon, and then he'll be safe! Mother, please! Don't ever mention that dagger ever again. It holds the darkest of magic. And using it to control your father would be an unforgivable betrayal. I'm sorry, Mother. I'll never betray you again. Gentry, make the boy trust you. Through the boy, that is the way. Mother? When are you going to turn me? Will the girl do it? She is inquisitive, but she will do as she's told. You have great faith in one so... insignificant. Don't underestimate that one. When I found Gentry, she was bathing in the blood of her parents. She's cut from my cloth and therefore exceedingly capable. What do you make of the intruder? I'll be speaking with the Captain shortly. Thank you, Henry. Aye. I know you're not asleep. Do you have a name? Called Frost. Ha! Got you. No. Bored. Pretty person chat with. So you'll answer some of my questions? In it for me. Well, what do you want? Another friend. I can do that. You've lost leverage. Wouldn't you answer a question for a friend? Smart. Only allowable questions. Okay. Where's Titus? Who attacked us and what do they want with us, and who are you and Mr. Personality? I can only answer about Titus. I must go back to the beginning. Cain is known as the world's first murderer. He's the son of Adam and Eve, older brother to Abel. When God favored Abel's offering over Cain's, Cain grew increasingly angry until one day he lured his brother to a field and killed him. God, of course, knew right away what he had done and marked him for eternity. Cain was then cast away from all he had known and left to wander the Earth aimlessly. And, because the Earth would no longer yield to him, he was forced to live off the blood of man. He became a vampire, cursed and immortal. Later, Cain met and married Lillith. Before turning Lillith, they had a son, Enoch, who also bore the Mark of Cain. No one understood the mark's power at the time. It was just a mark, or at the most, a reminder. When Enoch grew, he married and had children, and as Cain and Lillith's lineage continued on, each firstborn son carried the Mark of Cain. It wasn't until many centuries later that Cain discovered the mark represented a potential escape from the unending curse. You see, on the first lunar tetrad, he was wounded and almost killed by another vampire who bore the mark. It was then that Cain realized he could die. Lillith did everything she could to prevent Cain's death by tracking down and eradicating all who were unlucky enough to bear the mark. She thought herself successful until one day Cain found Titus. Now, Cain has taken Titus and will force him to end Cain's suffering through death. Titus taken? Where did you get that? What? It's none of your business. No. I don't suppose it is. Those chains should hold. This will quench his thirst if he awakens. I thought we just give him blood. He'll need more soon. In his weakened state, Frost cannot protect you. When Sonny awakens, feed him. Come, Gentry. We have business to attend to. Joce? It's okay, sweetie. I'll be back. No. This shouldn't happen yet. Frost, keep her safe. Great. But I can do it. I promise. I know. I know I missed a few days. My son had to go to the doctor. Please. Please, please, please. I need this job. Please. Hello? Hello? Hello? It's okay, Mom. I have this, or I can find a job, too. I've seen lots of kids throw away soda cans, so I can collect them. You're such a good boy. I'm not kidding. Tie, he gave me these. He said I can be like Superman for the whole day. I could. I can save the president, and he would have to reward us. He would. But you know, how about we save these for a time when we really need your superpowers, okay? We're going to be fine. Coming! Luke, can you go get your bath ready, okay? No, I can't. Okay. I'll be right there, okay? Coming! Frost, what can I do? What do you mean? How am I supposed to help? Can't just sit here all day. It's so bright. Sonny? Blood ready now. Joce? Do I give it to him? Set in reach. Let me out! I'm so sorry. He jumped at me. Please don't. Sonny, are you okay? No please Sonny. It's okay. You have to stop yourself. Please. Sonny! Frost? Friend. I'm so sorry. Sonny broke the chains and Frost saved me. I'm so sorry. I was just so clumsy. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. No. I underestimated the timeline. It's all changed because of my arrival. No. Mrs. Frost. No! You monster! Please don't hurt the boy! Please don't hurt the boy! I've got superpowers! Forgive me. How could you! Let me be, child. - Let me be, child. - Let you be! Let me be, child. You want you to let you be like you let them be? I didn't. You did! Where's Luke? What did you do to him? Where is he? I didn't hurt them. - I didn't hurt them. - Liar! I didn't hurt them. She is right there I would never hurt them. It's me, Jocelyn. Frost didn't tell you the whole story. When I killed Cain all those years ago, I inherited a curse seven times worse than death, and with no one left bearing the mark, I will never die. My rage at this fate, including the loss of all I have loved, caused me to turn into the monster you see before you. I stepped into Cain's walk and helped the world close in on itself. No human, vampire, or animal was safe from my wrath. Finally, there was nothing left, and in silence, I waited. I would've stayed insane if not for Frost. He came up with the idea of coming back and stopping myself, stopping Titus from killing Cain. The calculations were like finding a needle in a haystack, but somehow, and just barely, we made it. This is the end. We have finished. It's beautiful. Yes. Now it's time for you to join Lillith. It's going to get very painful. But I think I know the answer. Do tell. The only thing death can provide me is freedom. I want to be free. You may now free yourself. Thank you. Well, that's a pity. I wanted her. To die in dust. Death shall all the world subdue. How I envy her. Yes, Husband. Do you remember the view from the Eiffel Tower, or our private gondolas in Venice, our evening walks through Amsterdam? So many memories. And yet, not as many in this country. But it is so new. Imagine what we could do here. End mankind, or allow it to continue, an entirely new adventure for you and yours. Cain- - Dispose of Gentry. The tetrad draws near. Must we do this? Her purpose has ended. My love, she has further purpose, I can assure you. Explain. She is my vessel into the boy's mind. There will be memories yet to alter. Plus, this boy, your boy, is fond of her. He considers her a friend. She will convince him to do our bidding. My bidding. Yet you've reasoned well. Can you accomplish this? Of course, Husband. I will make her irresistible. Lillith. This tetrad is my last. Do not stand against me. Promise me. You have my word I will not stand against you, but that girl is mine. I will be back for her. Why must he speak of Gentry? Perhaps he wants your focus on the little things. If you're happy with a small victory, you may leave the big one alone. He is mistaken. Why must he do this? He's been walking this Earth a right long time. No longer than I, and I want nothing more than to be here with him. His crew is not giving up on their captain. There's still hope. Even the tiniest of lights can pierce the dark. That's what I'm afraid of, Henry. So what's the plan to save Titus? We should wait for Jocelyn to awake. I won't to explain myself twice. Finally. Tomorrow night, I will kill Cain and free Luke and save Titus from ever becoming this monster. My loved ones will be able to live on, no matter what form of life that takes. Your loved ones will live on? What about you? I have lived for thousands of years, ruled this very world, and was its end. Only I remained. I tried to die a thousand times. After the anger dissipated, a giant void took over. It wasn't loneliness I felt, but rather deep and utter emptiness. When Frost came to me with hope, I realized I had been lacking the most important thing of all, something even Cain had managed to have throughout his journey. I lacked love. Sonny, Lucian, my mother, and you, Jocelyn. And me what? I should not say. You kidding me? - You kidding me? - I do not joke. I do not joke. You said you'd anser my questions so answer them Jocelyn, as a boy, it was no secret to anyone around us. I was deeply infatuated with you. But what they didn't know is that it ran much deeper than that. Through the years, I tried to replace those feelings with others, with anything. Yet, after a thousand lifetimes, you've never left my heart. Even in the end, all we are is what we remember. Jocelyn, I'm sorry if I said something you didn't want to hear. I don't know what I wanted to hear. What do you mean? I've waited a really long time for Titus to figure out how he feels about me. And last night before Cain took him, told me that he loves me. I know. He never got your answer. Do you? Yes. What happens when you kill Cain if Titus doesn't? Will you cease to exist? That's one possibility. What if you both disappear? What if... What if you and Titus are exactly as you should be? I'm an abomination. I shouldn't exist. If that's true, then Sonny and I are abominations, too, because we wouldn't be here if you hadn't come back. So should we not exist? Jocelyn should always exist. Okay. Then... Maybe we should let Titus fulfil his purpose I know that we're still going to have to be there to grab Luke, but- - You'd join me? Of course. I mean, you're Titus, too. No, I'm not. You're but a child. It's not as simple as that. Life isn't this fairytale. You, Lucian, and even Sonny will all die one day. I can't protect you forever. So we'll find another way. There's always a way. No. No one can survive. So you're not even willing to try? It's pointless. - You're wrong! - There is no hope. No, you're wrong! You say that it's pointless, but we need you. We all need you. You're the only one who knows what the future holds, and you're the only one who can stop whatever it is that's going to happen, and you're the only one who can help alter it. Jocelyn, I forgot how smart you are. Did I change your mind? No one can. Then this isn't over. I'm not going to let you die. I won't let either of you die. Hello? Hello? Let me out! Gentry? Yes, it's me. I don't know what's going on. Why am I locked up in here? We were attacked by vampires, Gentry, vampires. Yeah, and they saved us. I know, but where are they? You were just out there with them. Yeah. I don't know. They've given me a small amount of freedom while you heal. Whatever. I'm leaving. Ah. Get out of my way. Just wait. They're coming. Besides, they wanted me to come in here and wait with you. Fine. I don't know how much longer I can just sit here. They took Luke and killed everyone. I can't even think straight. They said they tried to save them, but they were too late. I'm so sorry- - I'm going to kill him! Don't worry. You'll get your chance. Who are you? I am called Cain. And when I speak, you will listen. One of my children has taken a particular interest in you. It may seem strange but you alone possess something very special. The mark upon your back is God-given and holds a sacred power. Because of this, it's the target he's after, and unfortunately, only you can stop him. How do I kill him? In two days' time, a great event takes place on the blood moon, the tetrad. It's happened only four times in history. If I were to turn you into a vampire on that day, you would become a god powerful enough to do just that. Two days' time, boy. Think on it. I know it's a lot to take in. I just don't understand. Why did they kill them? I know. But we'll make them pay for it. What are you talking about? I don't even know you. You're just some weak little girl. Shut your mouth! I've been through more than you'll ever know. I watched as the life drained out of my parents' eyes that night, and it was... terrible. I know we lost your friends, so forgive me if maybe I don't want that to happen to your brother too. Gentry. You know nothing about me. Wait. Damn it! Hello, my boy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where's my mom? I want to be with her. Ah. Of course. Well, unfortunately for you, your mother has been marooned, indefinitely. I've brought you some food. I'm not hungry. No? I just want to go home. What are those? Nothing you need to concern yourself about. May I suggest eating a little so you can keep up your strength? I suspect you're going to need it. Okay. Sink me, boy! Always clumsy, Steven! Steven? I'm Luke. I'm sorry. Aye. I suppose you are. I can't eat meat like that. It's not cooked. I don't suppose you can. I'll have Maggie cook up something a little bit more palatable, Luke. Hello, daughter. Mother, this bag of flesh doesn't trust me! I can see it in his beady little eyes! I just want to gouge them out! I've come to fix that. But I thought love spells didn't work. They don't. I've decided to switch out the memories of the one he loves. She seems to be the only one he trusts completely. From now one, your name is Jocelyn. Our meeting is about to take place. Jocelyn, go behind that rock and do not leave for anything. Is that understood? - Fine. - I need to prepare. Whatever. Come on, Sonny. Joce! I'm sorry for yelling. I just don't understand. I thought you were dead. Then I didn't recognize you? I just can't believe it. You're alive. Of course, silly. Cain saved me too. But you've been all out of sorts lately. It's hard losing loved ones. I've been out of sorts myself. So tell me, why do you get to go in and out but I have to stay? Because they know I would never leave you. Besides, I'm not the important one here. You are. You have a very important choice to make. You know me, Joce. I'll do whatever it takes to save my brother. And that's why you're my favorite. I'm you're favorite, huh? Since when? What? In the mood for yet another drudge, my queen? Now you've done it. I've lost my appetite, even though little Margaret is quite precious. Well, Maggie is quite useless to me now. What is it you want, Henry? I've had some time to observe, and your... witchery is making me uneasy. Hmm. You've had time to spy? No need. Gentry performs perfectly. It's almost time to initiate part two of the plan, in which your assistance is no longer required. But then again, Henry dear- - Yes, Your Majesty. Clean that thing up. Maggie, do you think you're worthless? You'd be wrong. Your queen soon comes with a trick. Of course she does. Have you taken care of the child? Luke? He's sequestered. He has a name already? Perhaps when you're through with this business you'd like a new pet. That won't be necessary. My presence has been requested by that vampire. Do you want me to take care of this situation? Interesting. He's been protecting the boy's two friends. Go ahead and tell your men I want them dead, but leave the traveler to me. It shall be done. Captain Henry Every. I'm tired of playing this game, Captain. It's time I got some answers, now. Yes. Come along, boy. You want to know why I picked you as my apprentice, yes? I murdered your king. It makes no sense. I had a son once. You had a son? Do you want to hear or not? I'll shut up. Yes, I had a son once. Not of my blood, but of my spirit. Steven. We were brought together by a mutual love of the open sea. Even when he was just a cabin boy, he had better sea legs than most of my crew. Sure was a clumsy lad, always knocking over his plates. He had that light in his eyes. Maybe Cain saw it, too. I still don't understand. When he summoned for the boy, I couldn't refuse. I told Steven to do as he was told. They came to this very place that night, and I was too late. Arrived in time to watch Cain rip the heart right out of his chest. You remind me of Steven. Plus you killed that bastard Cain. I thank you from the bottom of all my black heart, I do. How may I be of service, old chap? I swear, if this is just some ploy to get me to shut up- - No. Something is out there. Bill? What? No. That's not him. Bill! Hello, son. Bastard! Sonny, don't do it. Get back here! For my men are hungry, stout, and resolute, and should they exceed my desire- I cannot help myself. You're the boy. I had a feeling you'd know. What is it you want? I will kill Cain again. To what end? To save myself from what I've become. The result will be the same for you. You know of my plans? Yes. You desire his throne and my support as your apprentice. I've lived it once. But on the night we enslaved mankind- - Captain, Master is ready for you. Hello, Imitator. Today is the day. Why don't you just kill me already? You threaten me enough and take away the only friend I've ever had. I should kill you, and I probably will. You're the only piece I have left of Steven. Then why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you. I hate what you're not. No! I have to stop you! I will! No! I will get out! I will not lose you! Kneel and be crowned. I, King, do knight thee as fellow king of our people. Xane! - What is this? - What's going on? Xane, dagger, betrayal. Henry- - Henry- - What? Henry- - He's lying! - Enslave! You! He's finally broken down. Reveal all at once. Your life depends on it. It was under his orders, sir. No. They're all lying! This is mutiny, conspiring against both of us! Haven't I always treated you like a son? Remove your gloves. My gloves? Don't play me for a fool. I know this dagger. Can you blame a mate for trying? Yes. I can. Well, maybe this time, the old has passed away. And the new has come. Find your light, Henry. Hello, Frost. Frost? That's not my name. Who are you? You killed the Captain. The one who kills your master becomes your new master. Is that correct? Well, maybe. Yes. Join with him. What? Ew. No. That's incest. I command you. I despise you. I know. What are you waiting for? Can I get some privacy? You're in big trouble now. The boy is mine. I have a job to finish. Leave him alone, Bill. Haven't you done enough? This is the worthless boy I told you about always running to his mommy. Well, that is, until I killed her. And this is his girlfriend. I'll kill you! That's a good one, Sonny. I should've finished you the night I drained your mother. Too bad Cain's golden boy showed up. Wish it would have been your girlfriend. Bet she would have been even more fun to drain then mommy eh? I guess we'll find out! No! Get Off! Not my day, eh? Helpless, and of course, you always were. Let me knock your mother around while you hid in your bedroom. But that's okay, because we both know that she liked it. Don't you dare talk about her! Oh no. What are you going to do? Nothing, right? Just like that night. You're going to stand there and do nothing, aren't you, son? Sonny! Get up, Sonny. Let's end this. Leave him alone. You don't just get to handle this, Tie. I'm not Titus, Jocelyn. You're bleeding. Am I going to turn now? No. You must drink from the one who bit you. Good. I'd rather die then be like one of them I didn't mean that. Your wounds need attending to. May I help you? No, no. I don't need your help. Wait. What's wrong? That bastard is torturing Luke! No, no, no! Wait! Look. I heard them talking earlier, but I don't know if I should say. What? Tell me. Cain's wife said that he's been lying to you. If you become a god, you can't save Luke. Yeah, but I would have to to save him. She said that he'd been using you. He wants to use you to kill his competition. If you become a god, Luke dies. That can't be right. Are you sure that's what you heard? Titus. What are you doing? I know your angry, but is your revenge more important than your brother's life? No. Do you trust me? But what- - Have I ever led you astray? No, ma'am. What are you doing? Henry has not returned. I thought I'd serve you your port tonight. Yes. Henry's absence can only mean one thing. And what is that? You've plotted against me, Wife, but you've failed. That vampire is my boy from the future. I succeed tomorrow. My love- - Did you think I would not know? Please forgive me, Husband. You know it was bore from a place of love. Yes. No matter. At this final hour, let us rejoice. My freedom is inevitable. The curse will soon fall from my shoulders. Very well. Let us celebrate our last night together, Dear One. I know you, Lillith, too well. Let this end tomorrow. A wise woman knows when she's been outwitted by her betters. Here's to us. A match made in hell. Do you know where to take him? Yes, Mother. She's not coming with us? I must keep Cain distracted. Mother, I... Now go. Quickly! Come on! You've disappointed me, Lillith. What are you doing? I don't know. Just looking at some old scars, I guess. You know, Bill wasn't always such a bad guy. For a while there, I thought... I thought he really loved my mom. And then, he changed. Yes. He was turned by someone, probably Henry, and eventually became the worst part of himself. Is that what's going to happen to me, too? I mean, I can already start to feel myself changing. I killed people yesterday. Is that what you meant when you said you understood the decay in my heart? There was a time I would have said yes, but being here now, I'm not certain. You were different from Bill before. Perhaps, should you choose, you'll be different from him now. So what's the answer? Some might say forgiveness. I understand its difficulties, though. Morning. I take it we're still going through with the plan? We'll head up beyond the hills. It should only take a few hours. - It should only take a few hours. - Okay. It should only take a few hours. Well, I still think that you're wrong, so I will just have to convince you otherwise on our way there. Master, we couldn't find them. We won't stop looking. Should I send out more patrols or- - Contact no other house. Summon Lillith's children to my lair. I have a reward for you all. So, who did you meet yesterday? I met a man Who had the present version of Frost with him Frost! This guy just gave him to you? A corpse has no choice. He'll soon be back to his old self. So... you just take what you want and kill without care? Yes. As I said before, I'm a monster. No, Tie. Xane. I think I'm going to be sick. So, how many people have you killed? All of them. That's nice. Hey, do you smell that? No. Who did this? Bill. He's there. I couldn't resist in partaking. I only have business with my stepson. Your business involves me now. Tie, no! You need to end this, now. It's just you and me, kid? Think you've got some balls now? I doubt it. Got a fresh haircut. We can have some fun with that girl of yours. You make me sick! See? No balls! You were worthless as a kid, and you're worthless as a vampire. Change in plans. Take me to a hospital. You're going to miss your meeting. Guess I win. Joce, I have to do this. No, no, no, no. You can't turn me. Promise me. Promise me. Tie. Welcome, my children. Today, you will receive the greatest gift of all, your freedom. I hope you realize this is your doing. I get no pleasure from this. Run! Why, Cain? You should not have tried to deceive me. But yes, I do remember our time together. They will be my last thoughts. But it's time for me to find peace. Goodbye, my love. We're almost there. It's right past this ridge. Joce. Joce. Jocelyn! Oh, right. What? I just... I'm just really glad you're here with me. Ah. There'll be time for that after we save your brother. Okay? All right. See it? There it is. Thanks. So, how do you know he's in there? There's only one way to find out. I don't see anyone. He said he would be here! My head. What's going on? We should get out of here right now. No. We cannot walk away. Kiss me. Joce, what are you talking about? I said, \"Kiss me.\" Rest well. What? Who's... I can't... Well done, Gentry. You've pleased me. It is my pleasure to serve you, Master. Are you fond of this boy? No! He disgusts me. Sounds like a match. With your newfound abilities, together you would dominate the world. I will now fulfill my end of the agreement. After I turn you, wear this, and as long as the dagger remains in Lillith's heart, her power belongs to you. I'm ready, Master. When is she going to wake up? I need to wash all this blood off me. Stop asking that. She should awaken at any moment. I heard she might not be too happy, though. Hello, friend. It's so bright. It's not going to be like that forever. My throat. It burns. Joce. Jocelyn, I can assure you this was all done for the best. Why? I didn't want it, not like this. I know, and I thought about that, and I tried to stop him, but he showed me. It was like the light was leaving your body. I couldn't even imagine. Did you turn me? No, no, no, like he'd even let me if I wanted to. Did you want to? No, no! That's not what I meant. Shh. You're too loud. Where is he? So is he hiding from me? Joce, don't. Joce, you're not as tough as you think, you know? Frost, it's nice to see you again. Where is he? What? I can't tell you. That would defeat the whole purpose of everything. You're wrong. Everything has changed. I'm sorry. I would never betray a friend. Frost, what happens when the person who changes you dies? You die too, right? Yes. Xane changed Sonny and I. So what happens when he dies? I could lose all my friends. He's at the ritual grounds. It's to the east. Welcome. I'm glad you made it. I believe it's time that we met. I assume you're the reason Henry Every never returned. Leave the child alone. What child? This child? Do not harm him. I have no choice. I must harm him to get what I want. I need no incentive to kill you. I wouldn't do that. If I sever the boy's head, he'll be gone forever. Why do you oppose me? This is your moment of freedom. Stop! If you touch the boy again I will sever your head Such anger, but your presence in this timeline has woken my appetite. Why must life do this, at the moment of my deliverance present a challenge of my equal? You are nothing compared to me. Can you feel it? We're on the brink of death, of freedom. I know you understand. You've been trapped, imprisoned in this life. No! This life is a gift. You lie to yourself. Such weakness. \"Such weakness,\" says the one hiding behind a child. Let fate decide who goes free. Fate cannot stop me. I feel alive again. You can't beat me. You forget, boy, I am the original. Witness my true form. You are no match for the truth. I am truth. No! Don't! We end this now, like before. No! Our battle has just begun! You've given me a reason to live. Titus, it's okay. - It's okay. - I will rid this Earth of everything you hold dear. - No, no. Hey! - Luke! Titus, wait! Titus, we have to go! Titus! Until the day- No! - What? - Stop! You're next. Titus, I failed. What? Sonny, we need to get to Lucian and cauterize his wound, but I need you to keep an eye on Jocelyn while I do. Wait! Joce, wait! Stop me. No! How is she so strong? - Stop! - Help me! I can feel it. What am I? I'm going to kill you. You're nothing! Thought you could take my family and get away with it! Joce! Sonny, do something! He needs her! Joce, help me! Pathetic. You don't even fight back. You're nothing in the presence of a god. Sonny! He needs her! Joce! Xane, help me. You may have the power of a god, but you lack the understanding. Here. Bite. Go to Lucian, please. Okay. Is Titus going to be okay? Yes. That type of wound cannot kill him. How could I even think about hurting Luke? Newborns have great difficulty controlling themselves. You'll soon learn to overcome your cravings. Why did you turn me? Always full of questions. Joce, I had no choice. Allowing your light to extinguish was unacceptable. Looks like history repeats itself. Yes. I failed. No. No. Don't ever say that, and don't you ever give up on me. Why? Xane, Lucian will be fine. I disinfected and cauterized the wound. It missed anything major and his vitals are all at an acceptable range, but he'll need medical attention as soon as possible. Good. Get him to a hospital. I'll take care of these two. Sonny, today would have turned out much differently had you not been here. Thank you. Do you still thirst, Jocelyn? No, I feel better. Good. We should leave. Xane. Yes. Promise me you will never leave me, you'll never give up. Why? Because I need you. I need both of you. Xane. Promise me. I promise. Hey. Can we give that to him? He needs time, Joce. Time? For what? Time for what? Healing isn't easy. I know. Hey, Joce. Oh, thank you. I'm starving. Do you remember when we used to eat real food? Your mom made the best lasagna. Yeah. Those were the good old days. I missed you, Joce. I can tell when you're lying. I'm sorry. All the memories are there, but your face isn't the one I see. It's fine. Hey! Wait. When am I going to see Luke? I'm flying out to get him tomorrow. Actually he's feeling a lot better. Wouldn't it be better if Sonny went? I mean, he knows Sonny. He knows me, too. Sonny is staying here with you. You're more comfortable with him, but that just means I get to go and bring home my favorite Frost. Okay. Thanks, Joce. Of course. How'd it go? That well, huh? I need to go get some air. I wish I could have heard her one last time or seen the light shining in her eyes. I missed her by a minute. Can you go back and try again? No. That was my only chance. You saved both her sons. I know. How's Titus? He's safe, which is what matters. You have something on your mind. I have memories on my mind. Why are your memories different than Titus's? It's the flow of time. My mind has had thousands of years to unweave itself. I remember you telling us once that all we are is what we remember. You remember me. He doesn't. He will. And I will not forget. I have no map or memory for this either. But you, Jocelyn, are my North Star. You know, sometimes, I really miss you, Mother. Sometimes. Hello, my love. Joce? Of course, silly. I can't take this anymore. I'm about to break. I'm coming for you.

Soon, we'll be together. to the free world outside. I'm not looking for him, I'm looking for you. I hope you can teach me Xanda. Xanda?Impossible. I won't teach you. Leave? If it's because that I.. I did not honor you in the first place, I'll appologize now. I hope that you don't mind. Look at yourself. You wanna learn Xanda? Don't downgrade me. I hope you can just give me a chance. You really wanna learn? Can you suffer it? I can. I will follow your orders. OK,you can't smoke and drink here. I won't. You can't go out in daytime. You must keep early hours. I can do that. You can't fight outside. OK. And the most impotant thing is, you can't fall in love with anyone else. OK,No love. Qiang, I know what you're thinking. You thought that I dont wanna help Shrimp. You practice Xanda. Can you make money? There's something important at the end of this month. I've got to attend that match. You wanna attend the King of Newpeople Xanda Match? To be punched by others? Don't waste your life on it. I won't, it's better than owing money to someone else. Singing is for free, but where's the salary for working at the Bar? Why you only give me money for playing the drum? That 10 thousand yuan you owe me.. Not including the interests... If you treat me better. I'll treat you better. This is my room key, 2000 I think you'll understand. Whatever you say. Aren't you afraid if I told you to get outta here? I still owe you money,will you let me go? OK,put your right foot behind. Keep your fist tight. Stick your feet on the ground. Qiang, don't be angry with your fist cover. You wanna learn Xanda?Let me teach you. Just use whatever you can on me. Beat me, and you can go to that match. Your movements are too obvious. So there's too many signs, understand? Xanda is evolved from matial arts. The key is :fast,change and power. Lower part is too light. The spirit of Xanda is fight,not style. Change from passive to initiative. Knock out the opponent as fast as possible. It's not showtime now, it's useless to be goodlooking. Relax. Keep yourself agile. Brother,where have you been? Brother? What? I'm looking for you. I'm coming! Here you are. This is published today. It really can take us anywhere? It really can take us anywhere? What a shame,it can't go anywhere with me. No,you take it. It will take you to anywhere you want to go. It didn't say that. Let's go,I'll take you to the post office. Let's go and see the world. OK? Where? I don't know,I haven't been there either. The anti-smash ability of the red is quite strong. Now it's the third round. It seems that the throw attack of the black haven't made any threat to the red. Right. To be a sportsman,you must attend a match. To attend just 1 match is better than 3 months of practice. I have only 1 opportunity for the match this time. Who of you would like to go? I will. I've learned a lot here. Now I feel like having a real fight. So it should be me who attends the match. After all, I am a student here. You will give me a chance, won't you? Who else wanna attend? This fight is really wonderful. It is really hard to say now that who will win. A high kick,both side is on the ground. Is that Miss Liu? Is that Miss Liu? I am Zhang Guoqiang. Now I can give you back your money. It's your turn! Don't we have a deal? We should share the expense. Really? I thought you won't give it back. Now I'm going to a Xanda match. This is a good way to earn money. I'll have to go,it's my turn. It's also my turn. If I win the match,I can get more moneym. Then, I'll give them all back to you. Alright,let's see. Welcome back to the Guang Dong's King of Newpeople Xanda Match In the next fight.. the \"Ares of Light\" Zhang Guoqiang will show up. You shouldn't let Qiang attend that match. But it's OK,someone at his level fight in this kind of match.. he could learn much. This is \"the Ares of Light\", Zhang Guoqiang. There's an old saying: Heroes what they are when they are very young. We hope that Qiang could make a great coup in this match. Then let's see his opponent. His opponent is obviously more mature than him. \"Knifekman on the Volcano\",Four Last time I lose just because this bad boy? 2 meals, a week Be good. He is one of my two best men. The meal for the week.... Please don't make us pay.... All sportsmem pay your attention please. During match time, The use of head,elbow and anti-joint attack is forbidden. The hit on hindbrain,neck and crotch is also forbidden. Alright,please wear your teeth cover, let's get ready for the fight. The points Zhang Guoqiang loses in this round is very precious. The situation is no good for him. And he is in the disadvantageous position all the time. You see. With this fall, the Red will win by 3 points. Yes. A Si is now using his knees in the attack. This kind of attack won??t help him to win points according to the rule of the match. But it??s really effective in weakening the opponent??s defensive power. The Black??s counterattack doesn??t work at all. As you can see??he has lose his CG(central of gravity). I??ve heard about Zhang Guoqiang--that Champion of Striking Skills. He??s just so so in my eyes. But it is said that this Lightening Fighting Lord has once been a Champion of Striking Skills. Yes. I feel that this honor may be an obstacle for him to conquer mentally. But under the circumstance of actual combat, this kind of striking skill is just?? If he gives up now, he can only win half of the points. Stop? But you must promise me. When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it. When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it. Four Five 4?????? Now, the circumstance of the inside is that The referee is asking Zhang Guoqiang to have medical check immediately. If he hurts badly??the match should be stopped. It means that Zhang Guoqiang will lose the match. Zhang Guoqiang didn??t play well in this match. What do you think of his future career? I??m now getting more interested in his opponent-- A Si??s potential. Lost 3 points again! Stop? Give up now! I can??t bear watching it any more. Shame on you! Come back several years later when you have mastered good striking skills. Look??A Si??the Red is now starting his combined attack. Seems that Zhang Guoqiang can??t do any counterattack. Zhang Guoqiang fouls. Yes. He has used his elbow. The referee is warning Zhang Guoqiang. No, he just wants to deduct Zhang Guoqiang by 1 point. It seems that his name should be added to the list which shows the ones who have lost the most points in the free combat. Yes. He fouls again! He hit on his opponent??s afterbrain. He should lose1 point. If Zhang Guoqiang continue doing so, he may become the most points loss athletes in this match. I can??t agree with you any more. Why do you come here, auntie? I don??t mean that. You won??t let me to find him again, right? I beg you, auntie. You??d better learn from me. Be cooler. Please don??t talk, be a litter cooler. That??s my fee of this match. I??ll try to pay the left back to you soon. You forehead is still bleeding. Come in. Let me help to heal the wounds. You??ve hurt your hand? You??d better leave the adhesive plaster for yourself. Oh, wait, I don??t mean that. It is you who come here to help me voluntarily. I don??t know what I have done just now. Don??t ask me at first. Leave me more time, all right? Leave me more time, all right? Here??s the wound. Do you want me to help you to rub some medicinal wine? No, thanks. In case that you will hit me when you??re so close. I can try not to close to you. You, please. You won??t ring me, will you? I??m back to school now. We have strict rules. We can??t make girl friends. Do you know that you still owe me some money? I??ll certainly pay it back, don??t worry. As an athlete who majors in Wushu, We can??t see Wushu as our only aim. It is through learn Wushu, we learn a certain kind of spirit. Matches shouldn??t be used as a way of moneymaking. Don??t think that you??ve already mastered in Wushu Within only a few days. Wushu is a kind of self-cultivation. When we encounter frustration, we should learn something from it. According to your training level, you can??t hit the punch bag. Do some cleaning outside. Hey, coach, what on earth makes you always treat me like your enemy? This is my training style. If you can??t bear it, you can leave this school. Leave school? Leave which school? Have you taught me? Am I your student? Since I have been enrolled by this school, What on earth have you taught me? You say you??re a coach. Have you done what a coach should do? OK, I haven??t taught you any more. And I haven??t fulfilled my duty as a coach. These are what you??ve cognized? It seems that you cognition ability is so poor. Not better than a pupil. It really makes you uneasy to attend the match. If you want to continue you training program, you??d better do the cleaning. Clean all the building. Out? Yes? I??ll go there, coach. Cleaning. Coach, coach.. A Qiang got hurt. Can he have a two-days break? He??s just the person who should do the cleaning everyday until he changes his personality. Stop training! I won??t teach him Xanda, either. Coach. Enough, don??t bother me any more. I know that you don??t like me, I will leave here. A Qiang. Will he feel satisfied if I don??t train Xanda? But I won??t do the job free of charge. You owe me the fee. Good things with evil purpose. Dear audiences. What about you feelings? How time flies. It??s weekend again. Maybe it will make you much more clearer. To plan for the next week. Don??t miss, it??s shinning outside. What a cozy weekend! Just have a try and go abroad. Bask under the sun and breathe the fresh air. You can conquer all the difficulties in this week. To manage all the things. And have a look at you who just woke up. What else you haven??t done in this world? Is there a friend who is waiting for your calling? If so, you should pick up the phone as soon as possible. Dial the number. And say hello. How??s your feeling recently? Have you missed me? Have you thought of doing something else? Tell him that the Dawn Light Line hasn??t lied. I stay here waiting people to catch the Time Train together. Run to the first day of future, week Brother, why you treat me so good? Are you afraid of losing friends? Shit, I??m not like your type. Shit? You??re afraid of losing the match. You??re afraid of losing the match, and nobody will call you champion. They all leave you alone. You??re not so confident. Won??t you attend the match in the future? It doesn??t mean that you??re the champion forever. Have you heard that Afraid of defeat is also a defeat. Do you agree with me? Come back, A Qiang. Come back, Zhang Guoqiang. You lose. Who has beaten you? I beat you. Why you chose losing the match? Coz you have legs, but I have no choice. If you continue saying so, I??ll make you stay here forever. Actually, I can climb over it. Then, you will be defeated to a much more extent. Clothes have been washed. And I will leave these things here. I don??t care if you insist in returning them to me. Wake up. A Qiang? A Qiang. You son of a bitch? Get out! I think I can live happier in this way. I don't think that I look like my auntie. Thinking too much all her life. If you wanna go back home??do what you like. Wanna wander, the wander. Dangerous upstairs! If you want to say something, go downstairs. Let's talk about it clearly, I won't let you think too much. And you can't let me think too much, too. We both don't have to think too much. If you wanna go, To be freely, all right? O.K. But I won't change you. Change me? For what? For the time, if you can spare me a bit more time. Just a litlle is O.K. to me. But according to the other circumstances, it is most likely that the Red will win by several points. Please wait outside for the report. You are pregnant according to the report. Can you help me packing the parcel? O.K. Wow. Are you the Champion of Xanda? Yes. Any matches recently? Tonight, and it will be broadcasted lively. Where are you going? To the gym. Ladies and gentlemen, It is the lively show of Xanda Fighting of Guangdong Province. Tonight will see that the Black is from Oriental Wushu School.

He is especially good at striking skills and changeable fighting ways. And he has a powerful straight right punch. And his kicking skills of both legs are extrodinary excellent! Now let's welcome the representative of the Red. As we all know, he is Zhao Wei, the King of the Tower. And he has won 78 out of 80 matches. 2 draw matches and never loss. And he is especially good at shocking hitting power. And he can master all the striking skills. And his throwing skill is second to none. And on the other side, Zhao Wei is especially good at defence. He can never be beaten. Through recent matches in 2 years, he has become the idol of all the audiences. Let's welcome Zhao Wei, King of the Tower. Ladies and gentlemen, let's start the match. It's a challenge match. Whether Tie Dalong will win or not, Let's just wait and see. The bell rings. Tie Dalong strikes fast. It's his first round strategy. Just like the old saying: Best defense is offence. I think that Tie will win more points than Zhao. Back. Actually, Tie also hits very fast. It seems that Zhao has realy meet a level opponent. But Zhao has never lost a match. Will this match change his undefeated history. Will the Legend of undefeated Zhao finished? Tie really plays excellent. Wow Defence, Tie. It seems that Tie didn't play well than before. Clearly lose something. What's the matter? Maybe something happened to him. Hold on, Tie! The referee didn't know, either. So he didn't stop the match. Tie, up you hands. Stand up, from now on, you fight with me. If you can't beat me, you won't have the chance to attend the match. We should have stopped the match. But it's too late. Tie has lost the match. Zhao can continue his undefeated legend. You lose! You lose, nobody will call you the Champion. Have you ever heard that afraid of defeat is a defeat? Actually I can climb over it. If so, you will lose badly. Tie I, you daddy, haven't taught you well. No, every match has the winner and loser. It is a challenge to attend matches. I've tried my best. I know, one will certainly be defeated if he continues fighting. And I'm a man, I can accept the result. And I, your daddy, won't let feel frustrated. Never give up, I think you'll win one day. I won't, silly boy. Coach I apologize for my misunderstanding you. Please train me again. You want to revenge for Tie? Traing shouldn't be aimed at certain people. I know, coach. If you think it through, get up at six next morning and go to jog. Don't mention it. You should mind your own business. I just want to prove that I'm not escaping the reality. Yes, you are not escaping the reality. But if so, what are you doing? I just want to tell myself I'm not a man who is afraid of defeat. Let me stand on the arena to face the real me. Give me another chance. O.K., tell me, how about me? What am I doing? I've told you that we shouldn't have thought too much. We don't owe each other. Remember? And you promised me that you would spare me much more time. You said it. I remember... Continue you dream of the champion, I do hope you'll succeed. I don't want to be a champion. I just want to change myself. You'd better do so, too. Do you remember Zhao Wei? I have once wanted to change him, but now... Feel freely... You are not like the type of your auntie. And you are not Zhao Wei, too. Do you know? Yes, I do. Tie, don't fight with me with only one hand. Heal the wounds, I'm waiting to train you. Just play it. Indelicacy? What? Why do you come here again? I come here to prepay you salaries. I'll pay back all the money I owe you in this month. What do you mean? I will leave Shenzhen. What's the matter? Quarrel with your boyfriend?

Mind your own business, what I do is none of you business. I'll pay back what I owe you. Do you want to leave this place which made you feel sad? Who? None of them. This matches last for 4 rounds. Zhao Wei still continues his undefeated legend. From this match, we can find that Zhang Guoqiang's striking skills are not so bad. I should tell that your wife has been pregnant for 2 months. You should be careful recently and come here to have checked oftenly. Ladies and gentlemen, It's the last match of the Xanda Arena Fighting Match. Who will be the champion of this match. I do think that all the audiences here and people sit before the TV are waiting for the answer Who will win? Which one? What's the matter recently? I've to have the match. When? Soon. Wish you succeed. Are you all right? O.K. Has anything happened recently? Has anything happened recently? Don't you have something special to tell me? Nothing, just want to leave Shenzhen for a while. Do you want to go to the Northeast of China? Don't worry, I'll write to you. When will you leave here? I'll take the 10-o'clock-train. Tomorrow? No, now. A Qiang, it's your turn. Do some warming up exercises. Be careful. The match will soon begin. The first one is the Red. He's the one you all know Undefeated Zhao Wei, King of the Tower. And the Black is a greenhand athlete. His name is Zhang Guoqiang, Lightening Fighting Lord A Qiang, A Qiang. What's the matter with you? Nothing. No matter what happened, you'd better set them aside, and focuses on the match, O.K.? You can do it. Teethproof??teethproof Set what things aside? I don't know. I'm not wrong. Stop? A Qiang, what have you done? I have no time. I'm sorry, coach. Athlete Start? This reporter has just asked Zhao Wei. It seems that he's so confident. He want to beat Zhang Guoqiang within 2 rounds. Only those who are really confident can say so. But as we can see from the history of Zhao Wei, it will happen absolutely. And we can also find that Zhao Wei never mind the points. His only goal is to knock the opponents off. It seems that Zhao will do the same to Zhang, too. What we interested is that whether Zhang can continue fighting. Stand up! The first round finished. And Zhang Guoqiang didn't play well. The second round will start soon. What we all waiting is that when Zhang Guoqiang will be knock off. But the performance of Zhang didn't so good as before. He didn't look confident. All audiences have seen that he is always watch the clock on the arena. What makes me feel that he is eager to wait for the end of the match. He hasn't have the confidence to win the match. Possibly. Don't worry, A Qiang. I can feel that you don't focus on this match. Coach. I want to give up the match. No, Coach. No, Coach. A Qiang, you should face the real you! Be careful. Athlete, Ready, Start. The hit of Zhang really works. He put down the shoulder of Zhao Zhao failed to throw Zhang. As we all see. Zhang's fall to the ground. It's a kind of Wushu Skill, called Wu Long Rao Zhu. Zhang Guoqiang is starting to show his striking skills. In my opinion, Zhao Wei is always using MuayThai's striking skills. Zhang's paces are special. You see this is Kong Fu. Stop? It seems that Zhang is a bit tired. And he's still watching the clock. Zhao Wei hasn't successfully kncok Zhang Guoqiang off in 2 rounds. He maybe not so satisfied with the result. It seems that the next round will be much more exciting. Don't worry, I'll insist. A Qiang, show what Tie and I have researched. You see this one Oh? This is what he defeated Tie Dalong. A Qiang. Flying Whirling Kick. Another! Zhang has won many points from these two kicks. The bell rings. Zhang stopped immediately. In the rules of the match. His polite behavior will help him win 1 point. Zhang is now a bit ahead of the match. But this still can hinder his tiredness. Look, he's tired! With this spirits he maybe defeated. Very likely. On the other side, Zhao Wei is getting more and more feocious. Actually, Zhao's defence ability is far more better than Zhang's Round 4 begins. It is certainly that they both have lost much energy. Zhang is still stand on the arena. But Zhao has also hit by many straight punches. But Zhao has also hit by many straight punches. Stand up, A Qiang Stand up soon, A Qiang! Four Stand up, A Qiang. Too much energy loss. As you can see, Zhao can still show his skills. Zhang is in an inferior position. It seems that Zhang will be defeated. Xiao Nue? Fanfan? Hello? It's you? How are you? I am at home, my hometown. Does your father still have you speciall training every night? The signal just now... The signal just now... I know. Where are you now? I'm searching a friend. She's a girl. I've heard that it was her who has changed you. Do you know where she is? When I was washing, I found a note in the pocket. Her name was on it. I come here to find her You konw her. I've seen her. Finally, I know why you chose not to escape the reality. Finally, I know why you chose not to escape the reality. You've told me that people who are students of this school will be the champion, and he has been the champion? If he joined us, he can. Son, you're so young. To compare with you whole life, youth and time are far longer.

Never thought we'd see you back here again. Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it. Yeah. You said this place made you crazy. I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry. \"The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house. \"The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years.\" Five years? He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers. Who could pay off a house in only five years? Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash. \"A million dollars, man? See my manager.

Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands. Art world fails to suffer. News at 11:00. Cut it out. You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to. You know, we were all really pulling for you. Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away. Going out on his own. Really doing it. Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art. So what happened? It's what didn't happen. No bread. I fought it, that's for sure. Don't worry. I spend my whole life painting what other people want. I paint his van. I paint somebody else's mural. I paint Simpson's album covers. Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do. Well, you can try it again. You will, won't you? Look who decided to drop in. Where's your white flag? You have a way with words, Simpson. You know that? Same old wise-ass attitude. I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back. We did. But I have one question. Why the hell did you take me back? Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around. But this time no more artsy-craftsy Sonny Malone touches, huh? Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you. Am I coming in loud and clear? Yeah. Good. Here. You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started. That's great, isn't it? Picasso only gets to be called a genius. I get to be called the fastest painter around. Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend. You interested? Not right now. Hey. Mmm, she's great looking. I think that's this crazy girl I just ran into. Yeah? I was walking through the park. She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me. Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version. What did you do? Nothing. She took off. She took off? Come on! Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy? I'm gonna go find out who she is. You mean right now? Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why? - Because you're nuts! - Simpson's gonna kill him. Listen, Sonny, I told you. I don't know who she is. She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check. And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist. What do you mean, she doesn't exist? I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album. Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't! Down here at me. Now look to your right. Yeah, that's good. Listen, Sonny, I don't know who she is. How can you not know who she is? You took the picture. Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover. I snapped maybe 100 shots. In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame. The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets. I liked it, so I used it. That's the whole story. She just appeared? No, no, appeared then disappeared. Now, don't you go spreading this around. This is one of my best covers. Why do you want to know who she is, anyway? I like her. Hey, Lou. You seen her around here? No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right? Let me show you my daughters. That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning. Come on, get your balloons. Seventy-five cents. - I'll meet you later. - All right. Come on, come on over here. Hi. Hi. I'll take one, please. There you go. See you. All right, come on now. Hey, mister. What are you doing up there? Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid. A little lunchtime serenade? I don't mind. It's kind of nice. But I was just wondering where they laid out the body. I mean, you got something a little more upbeat? Sure. Better? At least it's faster. Here, give me a hand, kid. Sure. Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to. Want some popcorn? Yeah, thanks. You work around here, kid? Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records. You in the music business? What are you? Are you a record producer? A sound engineer? No. I'm sort of a painter. You, you paint at a record business? Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers. But why? I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores. Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh? Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours. You got it. You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired. It's a refined name for \"bum.\" I don't believe it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Hey, kid. Hey, wait up! Where are you going? Hey, you! Come on! Hold on! Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this. I'll bring it back. Sure. If you bring it back in person. You got it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Where are you going? Get that bike off the pier! Oh, shit! Whoo! You're a real Errol Flynn, kid. What other stunts do you do? Man, this whole thing is screwing me up. What whole thing? Ah, nothing. Come on, have a cup of coffee. Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger. Go on. What's on your mind? Okay. I run into this girl this morning. Never saw her before in my life. She kisses me and disappears. So what's so weird about that? What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint. I mean, that's crazy, right? Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her? No. Then why ask? So I'll keep looking for her. Okay, kid, but take a tip from me. What's that? Don't look underwater anymore. Thanks a lot. Hey, Al, where you going? Hey, Sonny. It's good to see you, man. How you doing, Big Al? How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van? Hey, and the chicks love it. Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work. It's beautiful, man. Where you headed? East. Where you going? West. Hang on. I'll give you a ride. No, that's cool. Forget it. I owe you one. All right. Okay, hit it. Relax and enjoy it, man. We're taking the scenic route. Yeah, just don't forget I'm back here. Hey, that's the place on the album cover! Slow down, I wanna get off here. Here? Thanks for the ride.

Now I've seen you three times in one day. That's a little too coincidental. Sounds like you don't believe it. Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth, I don't believe it. You're right. It's too coincidental. Someone must be setting us up. What do you mean? Hey, wait a minute! I didn't have anything to do with this! Really? Yeah, really, I didn't. Hey! Who said I was talking about you? You come here often? Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me. You must live around here then. Sometimes. Say, you think we could… See each other again? Yeah. Would you like that? Why? I don't know. I don't have a very good reason. I'd just like to see you again. Where are you? I don't know where I'm supposed to look. ♪ Bring all your dreams alive ♪ ♪ For you ♪ We'll see each other again. Bye, Sonny. How'd you know my name? Hey, wait a minute! I don't know your name. Kira. Kira. I was in big trouble. So what did you do about it? Nothing. Hi, Sonny. What are you doing here? It's early. Yeah, it's really early. I'm working. Well, that's wonderful. Oh, hello there. Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny? Oh, yeah. He works here. Always comes in late, though. Say, that's pretty damn good. It is. It's too good. That's what's wrong with it. It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you. Is that too difficult? If you want me to work, I'll work. If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too. Don't be a wise ass, Malone. That painting should be done. What are you wasting all this time on the girl for? Because that's how she really looks. I don't give a damn how she really looks. Just get it finished. Now, when are you gonna have it done? Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done. But that's only an approximate guess. Five minutes, my office. If it's six, keep walking. Sonny, what did you do? Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it. It goes with the job. Four minutes. What difference does it make? I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday. So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday. What does it cost? Oh, nothing. Maybe just the truth. Just go in there and agree with him. That's all he wants. You want me to say that Tuesday's Wednesday, right? Everyday of the week. Three and a half minutes. All right! I'll be right back. Sit down. You think you're pretty special around here, don't you? No. I never said I was special. Well, you're not. I mean, you didn't discover art, you know. Who do you think did that? I did. Surprises you, doesn't it? No, not really. Now, I've got an office, I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call. That's because I smartened up and I gave up art. I think you made the right decision. I want you to smarten up, too. Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them. But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there. That's art. Just paint what you're told to paint. If you start making changes, then other people start making changes. And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do. That's not a company. That's chaos. Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers. Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace. Tuesday's Wednesday. Hey, clarinet. How you doing? Hey, what do you say, kid. What're you doing up there? Trying to get down. Grab a hold of the ladder. Sure. Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves. Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. Malone and McGuire. Sounds like a vaudeville team. What you got there? Oh, this is a real gem. I've been waiting months for it. Ah, Glenn Miller. You wouldn't know about him. He was before your time. So was Beethoven, but I know who he is. Do you like Glenn Miller? Do you like rock and roll? I love rock and roll. I love Glenn Miller. This place is incredible. It belonged to a silent movie star. Obviously, they did things big in those days. What do you do with all this space? Nothing really. But I love this room because it makes my records sound great. Well, I've only got one thing to say. Remember, I gave you some popcorn. Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller. So, all set up. There he goes. Nothing like that sound, huh? That sound was a miracle. Hey, Danny, that's you. Yeah. Hey, this girl… Danny, there's this girl… Listen. That's me. Hey, that's all right. You got any more surprises? This is what I call my memorabilia room. Sort of the story of Danny McGuire. Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman. You really knew those guys? Yeah. We used to all hang out together. After I toured with Miller, I got my own band and my own club on West 51 st Street. It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by. Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two. Well, now it's a parking lot. Why did you give it up? Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction. It was a girl. The girl on the album. Yeah. The singer with the band. When she left, I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right? Boy, did I teach her a lesson. Never saw her again. After that, the heart went out of my music. I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable. Three cheers for comfort. You ever think about going back into music? No. Only about 20 or 30 times a day. So, you gonna do it? Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days. But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again. Why don't you? I've had real estate agents looking for two years. They can't find the right place. Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy. No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love. You gotta feel a special attachment, a special… Like you and your friend… Kira. Kira. Hey, why don't you help me look? Maybe you can come up with something. Me? Sure. You've got a good eye. Stranger things have happened. Yeah, I guess they have. Listen, I gotta go. I understand. I'll let myself out? Sure. So long. See you around.

Hey! Oh, I'm sorry. You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I tried to be quiet. How long you been standing there? Just a few seconds. Should I go? Oh, no, stay. You paint beautifully. This is the first time I've cared about what I've painted in a long time. That's a shame. It must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really matter to you. Yeah. I met a guy the other day. He told me I should take long lunch hours. A guy? Yeah. Someone I met at the beach. He's got this crazy idea he wants to build a club, and he asked me if I'd help him find a place. All the real estate agents in this town, he asks me, right. That's not such a crazy idea. You've got a good eye. That's what he said. If it's a place you want, what about this one? My place, where we met. That? Forget it. I think it has a very special aura about it. It's a dump! You're supposed to be an artist. Use your imagination. Thanks a lot, I'm all out. You know, I really think you believe that. I've had enough for tonight. Come on, let's get out of here. Okay. What's this? Shh, we gotta be quiet. I thought we were going skating. I wanna show you the special studio first. Only the biggest groups get to record here. It's really kind of magic. Mmm? Yeah. They flash all sorts of pictures on screens. Really? Can we see it? Straight ahead. But pictures in a recording studio? Why? For inspiration. Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect. I've only watched them do this a couple of times before. Let's see… Turn on that one. And this. I don't know how to make the whole thing work. Do everything. Go on. Press them all. I don't wanna break it. Then press them carefully! What the hell. I didn't like the job anyway. Let's see… Now will we see the magic? Sure. Come on.

Our first dance together. Followed by our first being-kicked-out together. Now I want to go somewhere else. Where? Find out more about you. You know enough about me. I wanna know about you. I'm serious. So am I. Well, after all that, do you think you'd let your imagination roam a little? Look, I won't even start in on that one. What are you doing? - What do you think you're doing? - Oh, nothing. Oh. Well, well, well. Now, what a coincidence. Look where we just happened to end up. You think you're real clever, don't you? Well, I just didn't want you to close your eyes to any possibilities. You really think this could work out for Danny? I think this place could be anything you want it to be. See, it's simple. Your friend has a dream, and you want to be involved in something you really believe in. Well, maybe his dream is big enough for the both of you. So here we are. Someone who believes that dreams come easy, and… Someone who doesn't know what they believe in. So just think about it, okay? Just think about it. You gotta be kidding. This place? They used to have wrestling here. So it's got a history of success. It needs some fixing up. I think it could look terrific. So could the Titanic. Kid, you don't need a builder. You need a demolition team. Look, I know it's a wreck now, but I can see it coming to life again. Just check it out, Danny. That's all I'm asking. Well, what put you onto this? A girl. Oh, that explains everything. Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a certain kind of aura about this place? Well, if that's what you call it, it's got it all right. Let's see the rest of it. Of course, it's not small and intimate like my club in New York. But then again, that was back in 1945 and things are bigger now. And this place… Whoo. Sure is big. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't know. Naturally, I can't take all this too seriously. But if I were going to do something about it, and I can't say I am because, you see, I'm a builder, and a builder has to take his time deciding these things. But if I were going to do something about it, just speaking hypothetically, it just might work. You think so? Might. If I planned it right. Let's see… Stage over there. Stairs there and there and back there. Kid, can you imagine it? Imagine what? A bandstand right over there in that corner. And a big band, like in the '40s. No, no, no. Bandstands went out with running boards. Over there… A great rock and roll band. This is the '80s. Real smooth dancers. Wild trombone. The band decked out in tuxedos. Six guys wearing electric orange. Synthesizer, heavy percussion, electric guitar. Lots of glamor. Everybody dressed in elegance and style. Do it, Daddy, do it. Yeah, man.

I can't take that. Why? I don't know the first thing about being a partner. Well, it's easy. We share the responsibilities and we argue a lot. It's like being married, without the good part. Come on, kid. Is it a deal? Okay. It's a deal. What do you know! I'm back in show business. Now, I can't wait. I gotta look over every inch of this place. I only wish we could see better. I got a flashlight in the car. Will you get it? Yeah. It's our first collaboration as partners. And, oh, partner? Partner, what'll we name the place? Yeah. What the hell to call it? \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree…\" \"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran \"Through caverns measureless to man \"Down to a sunless sea.\" \"Down to a sunless sea.\" Yes, Xanadu. I'm Kira. Of course. You're Kira. But… But? I mean… Don't I know you? I don't think so. Are you sure because… Because? Well, I mean… I don't know. I was thinking that I… Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it. So, you're gonna do it? Yes, we're gonna do it. Total insanity. Only if you think so. Well, even if it is, it's worth a try. Xanadu. How do you think that'll look on a marquee? - Hmm, wonderful. - Hey! When did you get here? Just a minute ago. What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute she's here, the next minute, who knows? Guess what you own half of, partner. What? Xanadu. Xanadu. Xanadu. Hi, guys. Hey, Picasso. Hey. How you doing? Let's see, what's first on the agenda? - Hey, who are you calling? - Leave a dime on the counter. Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone. I wanna see you right away. Hey, what's going on here? Who cares what's going on. Just get out before he gets here. Yeah. I'll fix everything up. I'll tell him it was a joke. Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay. Are you loaded? Because, when you sober up, you're gonna be real sorry. He should be coming in just about now. Malone, what the hell is going on? Simpson, I've worked like a dog trying to make Tuesday Wednesday. I couldn't do it. I must be a failure. Is he straight? You told me if I didn't do things the right way, I'd be fired. Well, you were right. Huh? I'm fired! Malone, I want you out of here in five minutes. That's five minutes, Malone, and if it's six, just keep walking. Got it? I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

No. You know, I don't know anything about you. Where you live, where you were born. There's nothing to know. Where do you live? With my sisters. Where? In an apartment. Yeah, but where's the apartment? On the second floor. Look, I don't even know how to find you. Yeah, but you always do. Okay. That's a dead end. What's your last name? Same as my father's and mother's. Yeah, but what is it? What? My father's or my mother's? I don't care. Either one. Same as mine. Okay, I get it. No questions. No questions, no lies. No questions, no truth either. Listen, you know enough about me already. Any more, you're gonna get a headache. Are you living with somebody? Yes. I'm living with my sisters. I told you already.

Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have one special toast, just the two of us. I've never had a partner before. I've never watched a dream come true. Hey, there's not much left. But, still vintage. Only the best. To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. And Glenn Miller. Hello. How's it all going? So far so good. Kira, I want you to promise me one thing. Anything. On opening night, I get the first dance. Okay. You're gonna dance? Oh, I've been known to twinkle a toe or two. Listen, if you're gonna dance, you have to wear something… That looks special. You need some… Glitz. \"Glitz\"? Something sharp looking. You know, something with a bit of pizzazz to it. - Hot. - Oh. Well, if I need some… Glitz. …glitz, then I gotta go get some.

You've made the place look beautiful. Just did What the kid said. Oh, I see a little Danny McGuire here and there. Oh, just here and there. Don't tell anybody, but I'm nervous. What about? Well, I haven't had an opening night since 1945. Wow! I guess I got the jitters. Well, just pretend we're back in 1945 all over again. I don't have to pretend. It is 1945 all over again. Well, that takes care of that. Sonny, don't worry about that sound system. I looked over it twice today and it's fine. You kids go on home. Bye, Danny. 1945. You did it. Tomorrow's your big day. It's all gonna come true. Tomorrow's gonna be the most beautiful day in the world. Kira. I love you. I love you, Sonny. What's the matter? All of it, everything. We can't go on pretending this is for real. I know, it is hard to believe. I can't have these kind of feelings. It's beginning to hurt. This part of it was never supposed to happen. I don't understand. What do you mean, \"hurt\"? I know I shouldn't, but I do, and it's crazy. Sonny, there's something I have to tell you about myself. I know all I need to know. No, I have to tell you. I have no choice. All I was sent to do was to make Xanadu happen. I don't get it. Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to hurt you. That was the last thing I wanted to happen. I'm not as I appear to you. Have you ever heard the expression, \"Kissed by a muse\"? That's what I am. I'm a muse. I'm glad somebody's having a good time. Please don't make a joke. I'm serious. I come from Mount Helicon. I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters. My real name is… Are you telling me that's not real? I'm trying to tell you the truth. Why don't you believe me? Look up the word \"muse\" in the dictionary. Go on. Page 728. Read it. Okay. All right, I'll read it. \"Muse. Any of the nine sister…\" Like the album cover? Hmm. \"Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek mythology \"presiding over song and poetry and the arts and sciences. \"And do you believe me now, Sonny?\" How'd you do that? What's going on? The television. Well, well, look who's here. Who's chasing you this time, Vargas? The cops? Or the mob? Don't get smart with me, Nick. I told you to stay away from Brenda Trent. Yes, you did tell me. What should I do, Sonny? Dive at him or make a martini? - What'? - Who you talking to? Sonny Malone. He doesn't believe Kira's a muse. How can you be talking to me? You're a movie. I ain't got time for this, Malone. Brenda's the only one that saw me at the racetrack. Now if the lady says she's a muse, she's a muse. Who's that? Brenda! Kira. Sonny. I think he needs a drink. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks. Good luck on the opening of your joint, kid. Wish I could be there. Oh, wow! Oh, Sonny. We've been painted by Michelangelo. Shakespeare's written sonnets about us. Beethoven's played music for us. We're not supposed to feel emotion or show any feelings. Muses are just supposed to inspire. I fell in love. You did? Well, what do you think happened to me? It was a mistake. I broke the rules. Well, now what the hell do we do, huh? Answer that, muse! I don't know. I'm sorry. It just never should have happened. Well, it did. I love you, Sonny. Kira. I'll love you forever. I Will. I'll love you forever. Kira! Wait! I'll love you forever. Hey, painter! I've been looking for you. Where you been? Here. Well, how do I look? Aren't you gonna say anything about my new threads? Hubba, hubba. Well, we're gonna miss you tonight. It won't be any fun without you. I told you. I can't go. Xanadu doesn't matter anymore. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? How can it not matter? This was our dream. Well, wasn't it? There's no Xanadu 'cause there's no Kira. She made it real. So find her! Bring her back! Dreams die. No. No, no, no. Not by themselves. We kill them. Now, if you give up, you'll be sitting on that rock 30 years from now, just like I was. I know how you feel, kid. I felt the same way once. I did. I didn't know how important love is. But let me tell you something. Somehow, somewhere, there's a way to get her! If she got here, there's a way to get there. Believe me, kid, it's up to you.

Sonny. How did you get here? You didn't think I'd let you get away from me, did you? You'll have to go back. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. I can't go with you, but you have to get out before it's too late. Too late for what? Oh, please, you took a big chance coming here. What's going on here? I'm taking you back with me, Kira. It can't be done. Nobody's ever taken anyone out of here. Not in the whole history of… The whole history. I'll make them let you go. Hey, Zeus! Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God. I wanna talk to you.

You'll leave now and you'll leave without Kira! Why? Because other people have dreams. So send another muse. You got muses running around all over the place. One dream, one muse. Wait… Wait a minute. Just listen to me, okay? Kira and I love each other. Now I don't know how often that happens in this kind of place, but back on Earth, it's pretty rare. We need to be together. All right, that's enough. You're leaving. Kira's staying. No more discussions. Those are the rules and that's all there is to it. On the other hand, dear, rules were made to be broken. We'll talk about that later. Which is later and which is earlier? - I keep forgetting. - Just a minute! Isn't anyone interested in my feelings? What do you mean, \"feelings\"? Oh, you remember, pet. We learnt about feelings in our mortal history class. Yes, feelings. I guess that's what you call them. I've never really had them before. I've never felt this way about anyone before. And I've never asked to leave here. Not ever. Not once in the whole time I've been here. No, it's true, dear, she hasn't. Not in all these centuries. Or is it minutes? I do keep mixing them up. Please, can't we just have this one night? Just one night? No, no, it's just not possible. Goodbye, Sonny Malone. Hey, Kira? Just one moment? Goodbye, Sonny.

{"title": "X&Y (2018) - full transcript", "plot": "An artist has chosen a famous male actor for them together, in the context of a feature film, to deconstruct themselves and their invading roles. They engage in a boundless play with their ...", "content": "It was a large room, full of people. All kinds. And all arrived at the same building at more or less at the same time. And they were all free. And they were all asking themselves the same question. What is behind that curtain ? Are you alright ? Yes. I'd say so. If you were an animal, which animal would best represent you ? A coyote. And what animal would I be ? I suppose you could be a small wolf bitch. And why do I think that ? Is that because if both of us were wolves, would that... Would that be some kind of compliment ? Or would it be because you have the role you have, here and now ? I don't know. Do you think there's a difference in being a woman, sexually, in the sense of receiving, or being filled up ? As opposed to being a man... And filling up ? Definitely. I'd say there's quite a big difference. But that is the way it is. What way ? - Things are much easier for us men. - How come ? I mean, if either of us didn't want to have sex, and I was the woman, I'd find that situation much easier to understand. Then, that's a kind of intrusion. Whereas if I'm the man, I might think, \"What's the problem ? Pants down, it'll be over in two seconds. What's the problem ?\" So, you're happy to be a man ? In that sense, I'm very happy to be a particularly manly man. I have no thoughts whatsoever of being filled up. Being a woman would be difficult ? That particular aspect of female sexuality involves certain elements I'd find very tricky to deal with. Actually, the producer bought me a strap-on when I said I ought to practise the male fucking motion. - Hang on ! Did you tell him that ? - Yes. I explained I needed one to understand what it's like to possess someone else. Didn't that get totally weird ? Yes, but isn't it very exciting that he's actually agreed to be fucked with a strap-on ? - What ? Did he really say that ? - Yes. Watch this. Interesting. If you wanted to use that on me, you'd have to be gentle. Are you serious ? Well... Let's put it like this... We entered into this project together. All in. We don't want any half-measures. I want to examine the concept of identity and what it means to be a human being. As an artist, I will, together with actor Mikael Persbrandt, live in a studio for periods of time. I want us to be able to work uninterrupted and unaffected by any external factors. We will examine both the internal and the external views of ourselves. The idea is to reach beyond the media pictures of us and find out who we really are. In the studio, we have set up an interrogation room where we will be seeking the absolute truth. Mikael and I will assign different actors the roles of our alter egos. They will portray different sides of us. Through them, we will be able to shed some light on who we have been, who we currently are and who we'd like to be. We have also built two consulting rooms where Mikael and I will meet our individual psychologists to process what happens in the studio. All our work will result in a feature film. The idea is that the script for this film will take shape gradually, based on the work we do together in the studio. I will write the script when we're not living in the studio. What's really great is that no one outside the project will ever know what's real and what's fiction. X&Y Are you attracted to me ? I'll tell you what I felt like before you got here, okay ? - No. - The external view. Why would that be okay ? I asked if you're attracted to me. I think both men and women get turned on by you. I don't know what you're on about. I asked you if you're attracted to me. Looking at the medial picture, I feel aggressively turned on. I also feel... angry. But even that is kind of playful. - Are you attracted to me ? - Yes, I'm attracted to you. I could do anything right now... Me too. I could have sex here and now. Me too. Okay... How would we set about it ? Show me. What would you do ? I'm not quite sure... What would I do ? You would... No, it's good like this. Don't you think we should save it for later ? I don't know. We've never felt one another. Now, we can. The good thing is that we can do it for real. But no one else will know it's for real. I don't want to leave here. There was a lot of talk about sex. I haven't heard you talk about it before. Maybe I haven't spoken about it, but it's a really important part of our identity and of being human. Well, maybe I'm the only one who doesn't get this single-minded focus... - No. It's not hugely interesting. - Look at it this way: Being the alpha male he is, it's a really important part of the picture. To me, the most important thing is you focusing on the total picture. Like you... writing a script. Listen, you won't find anyone willing to finance a film that's this unstructured. But the investigation has just started. I can't just make up the whole film ! I've been clear from the start: my work is explorative. Research, script writing and filming happen side by side. That's super, Anna... Mikael and I are known for crossing boundaries. I want to challenge the alpha male that's him. I want to record two sex scenes. One where he penetrates me, for real, and another one where I penetrate him. - That wolf scene... What's the point ? - I'll talk you through it. Mikael and I meet in a forest glade at dusk. I've got some wolf costumes I've made. I tell him I'll teach him to understand his inner animal. We undress and get into these costumes. And Mikael reacts to the fact that his genitals are uncovered. But I calmly tell him that wolves worry about totally different things. We get down on all fours and I start telling him how wolves behave. He's a bit stiff and questioning, but when I put my hand between my legs and then caress his face with it... Then, he takes me from behind, on all fours. - Hello ? - Hi ! - Were you sleeping ? - No, I was working on the costumes. Hey, I'm just calling to tell you something. I'm not saying we definitely do, but we may have a problem. Mikael's agent called and said Mikael mustn't have real sex. He's told his agents ? Yes, he's told them you want him to mount you when you're dressed as wolves, and you want to use a strap-on on him. So, he's told them, and that means those scenes are out ? I mean, they haven't banned sex scenes. Just penetration. - Ordinary film sex is fine. - What ? They're banning penetration to protect him. If you have sex, he might go back to abusing drugs again. - Okay. - I suppose he's got another life now. - They do this to protect him. - Protect him against me ? Honestly, Anna, I don't know. All I wanted was to... - To tell you this. - Okay, right. Bye. Oh, well... - Josefin. Scenographer. - Micke. - Hi, I'm Emelie. I'll be dressing you. - Hi, Emelie. - I'm Anders. Production assistant. - Nice to meet you, Anders. So, this is part of the team. Now, I'll show you your room. - Right. - Okay. - You can check it out. - Alright - you first. Exciting, eh ? Nice ! We can lose those. I don't understand that thing. Remove that, too. Oh, well - it's really nice. You'll be sleeping in here with all your alter egos. Maybe you wonder why I'm here ? I'd like to find out what your intention is. I set two criteria for any project I enter into. First of all, it must have exceptional artistic ambitions. Secondly, there has to be a realistic possibility of realising these exceptional, high-quality artistic ambitions. What do you want this to result in ? A bloody good film, quite simply. Is he really interested in finding out who he is or will he be playing a role? I'll never know, but he seems interested. How do you see the fact that I can consider having sex with him on camera? Well... That way, you get control over this sexual relationship. Moreover, you get to pick a man many women will envy you having got into bed. Envy you winning that conquest, I mean. But in that case, I could simply pretend we're having sex. I suspect you're more complicated than that. I don't think you want to pretend, as your ambition is to investigate reality. When I think of you, a line comes to mind: \"God's bravest angel.\" It's all about pushing right up to the limits. Even pushing past them, to reach what's beyond the human form, where you become a brave angel. A human being through whom God can be perceived. How would you describe an alpha male ? To me, the expression narcissist is more dynamic. In my view, a narcissist carries a self-loathing of enormous proportions which can only be overcome when he receives constant admiration and love from others. Is there a female version of the alpha male ? You could say there are two. One is the woman who consumes the man. Kills him after having used him. The female spider. Then, there's the one who's obsessed by the man and would never criticise him. As long as she gets the sex she wants, that's enough. A wonderful situation for the man. - It reinforces his dream of being... - An alpha male ? Anna uses these cliched images when she talks about my person. Like \"alpha male\" ! What the fuck is that ? I've spent my whole life struggling to maintain a sensitive... Struggling to survive with this over-sensitive soul. Are you troubled by the fact that she doesn't see your soft side ? - Yes. - I knew it. - That troubles me. - Yes. What the hell's an alpha male ? Really ? What ? As if I was some kind of fucking animal, eh ? - Hi ! - Welcome. - I'm Mikael. - Sofie. - Anna. - Sofie. I'll start by asking you to tell us: who's the character you'll be playing ? Based on what you know. Well, I don't really know who you are. Or I know very little about you. But I can tell what... What do you know about your character ? I know she or you suffered from mental illness when you were young. You're someone who can fall apart. What escapist behaviour do you have ? Drugs, alcohol... Conquests. Sex. Alcohol. Drugs. Conquests. Power. Sex. You are Mikael Persbrandt. You started off as a dancer, but went into acting. You have a long career behind you. You cross boundaries. You're destructive, and that affects a lot of people. I think that in your life, you're battling against different things you believe you have to live up to. I wish I would suffer less. You suffer a lot ? I feel I do. I wish I would suffer less. You suffer a lot ? - I feel I do. - Give me an example. I feel angst about my compulsion to adapt. Having to fit a template gives me angst. Are you lacking anything in yourself ? Yes, indeed. Many things. Like what ? Patience. Calmness. Clear-headedness. A context. How far could you go as an actress ? Actually, I think I could go all the way. I could do anything for art. It's like, when I'm on, I'm on. I'm not frightened. I do what it takes. - Sounds good. - Yes. Anything for art is great. - Okay, welcome ! - Thanks. This way. Is that my place ? No. Mikael and Anna will show you later where you'll be living. First, we're going in here. Here they are. - Hello ! - Hi. Hello. - Is everything good ? - Yes. - Really good. - Great. This got off on such a wrong bloody start. You were meant to be six alter egos, and here we only have four. Okay. That's... a shame. - Some producer fucked things up. - To say the least ! - Sofie and Shanti will be here soon. - It'll be fine. - Are we going back home then ? - Not at all. We'll start off like this, and they'll join us in a few days. Why don't the four of us just get going ? - That'll work. - Great. Here, we've got your character descriptions. - Can we have something to drink ? - Sure, feel free. - Thanks. - You don't drink juice. There. - Vera ? - You drink water. - Okay. - There you go. - Can I have some water ? - Sure, I'll pour you some. We've got... - Thanks. - You're welcome. As of now, you will be in character, constantly. Okay. And you'll take turns in telling us who you are. - Why don't you start, Trine. - Introduce yourself. I'm Trine Dyrholm, and I'm depicting the artistic, intelligent side of Mikael that sometimes crosses lines. - Good. - That's me. I'm Thure Lindhardt, and I'm doing Mikael's destructive side. According to some people. - Right. Vera ? - My name's Vera Vitali. I'm playing Anna's expressive, extrovert or somewhat provocative... Her provocative alter ego. I like challenging people I meet. - Exciting. - Yes, it is exciting. So, you cross boundaries, you explore things and you're provocative ? Tell us about you, Jens. Yes, go on, Jens. My name's Jens Albinus, and I'm a little scared... No, not scared, but I'm playing Anna's alter ego. The alter ego that's a bit scared. Scared that... And very uncertain that I'll be adequate enough. And possibly a slight fear of being a little boring. It'll be great. - We've got iPods for you. - With music for each character. - This is mine. - And for Thure. Jens gets gold. And remember that now you are working, and as of now... You are your characters. All the time. Yes. - One can easily get scared by you. - Why's that ? This is the second time you tell us we have to be in character. - Obviously, we're here to work. - That's what I mean. Well done, Jens. I think this will be grand. - This is it. - Wow ! - It's a bit messy, but... - It's beautiful ! I've been working a lot on these costumes. This place is awesome. - This is it. Please come in. - Yes, that'll work. - Nice ? - Amazing bed. - Nice. - I assume I'm in the middle. - Of course, if you want to. - Come on ! Hold your horses. - But what... Can't you... Why is fucking Mikael so important ? We like the challenge, and the playfulness. Life is so very hard. And if you play a little, that kind of makes it bearable. That's true, actually. Are we frightened ? As long as he's in on it, it's one hundred percent exciting. - See ! He's taken a territorial piss ! - Better now ? Hey ! Close that door behind you. - Is that my shirt ? - Which one ? - Mikael, are these mine ? - No, mine. Those are mine ! - Those are yours. The button-downs. - So, these are mine ? Can I see ? Are these mine, then ? I say ! Look ! You'd look a sight in this one ! - Shut up ! What do you know ? - Guys. Guys ! - Hey ! - What ? - Alright. Cheers ! Welcome ! - No, I don't... Hey, you two ! Could you please calm down a little ? - Okay. Where's the minibar ? - We haven't started yet. No minibar. - What did you say ? - There's no minibar. It's gone. - So, where's the alcohol ? Any vodka ? - There's no alcohol. - Are you serious ? - It's gone. Dried up. - Any drugs ? - Let's just buy something. Quit it. - Good joke. - It's no joke. - What do you mean ? - You want to snort a line ? - Whatever. We're portraying you ! - Trine, shut up ! - We're playing you ! - Put the glasses down ! Are you pissed off now ? Isn't the whole point finding out how far we can push him in this study ? How far he will go ? If we fuck Mikael, we rule him. That gives us the power. Yes. Nevertheless, if he wants to shag us... If Mikael Persbrandt wants to shag us, then maybe we aren't all that gross ? Maybe he'll even fall in love ? So, is this the concept of fucking the king of men ? Well, I mean... Part of it. All of that is part of this project. Okay. So, seeing this sex thing purely from a technical perspective, is it important to us that he's clean ? - I'd emphasise handsome. - Our goal is to go into this. That means we don't try to work things out in advance. We go with the flow. Right. - Why not tell us why it says FUCK ? - Give me a break ! - Alright ! Sure ! - Fuck ? Fuck ! Why the hell would anyone write fuck on their hand ? These are my war marks ! That's just how it was. - How ? - Quit it ! You want me to tell you ? - Yes. Tell us. - I don't want to tell you. - It's part of the project ! - It's my life ! If we're to work with you, you need to tell us stuff. When you've been in for 337 days a tattooist rolls up on methadone, very slow. I get annoyed with him, tell him to fuck off and leave his machine. And then I take the wire connected to the machine. Two wires which I intertwine while looking for a connection. So I tear down the kitchen light, connect those wires up, and then I connect that to a plug on the end of some fucking lead. And trying to use my left toe to switch it on, the machine jumps into life. People would say: \"Never do it yourself. And not your hands.\" Oh, your hands ? You did it yourself on your hands ? He did it himself ! Wow ! Damn... Let's play rock, paper, scissors and see who gets tattooed. One, two, three ! Best of three, eh ? Three, two, one, now ! Three, two, one, now ! No ! That's so frustrating ! Don't worry, no one will hear us here. Come on, come here. No... What are you thinking ? I only wanted a bit of fun. Isn't that what you want, too ? Go to bed. - And you... - Sorry. - I haven't forgotten. - Hello there ! - Hi. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - Good night. Goddammit ! Oh, two shoes. - Was it fun ? - Yes. - She was completely wild. - But you were not wild at all ? - Nope. - You're in no state to get it up. Nope. But it's no big deal, really. - Were you both coming to bed here ? - No, not really. - Were you going to... - Just come to bed. - Right ! - What ? Come on. Come on up, now. - There. - I'm too pissed. And your fly is open, too. I had a strong feeling yesterday, when I was about to tell you about my tattoos. I felt so fucking stupid. Because... Somehow... I would stage the mistakes I've made in life as a joke. I felt so incredibly ill at ease when I had to tell you about those tattoos. Because... this is... This is me. That's me. Get it ? That. All of that, that's my life. - Do you get what I mean ? - Yes. It's not exactly what I was told, but... Oops. - That's too much, isn't it ? - Yes. - But if we actually wanted to eat it ? - Some has to go. But we don't want to appear weird, so we need to be a bit careful so people don't notice what we're up to. - Take the slice of cheese on top. - Okay. - Fold it so it gets a bit more solid. - Okay. - Let's move that. It's way too much. - Oh dear. Sure. - More like this ? - Exactly. Just like that. If we're going to eat, we want it... Food is a kind of poison, so... If we're indulging in it, we want it to be tasty so you need more butter there. We don't want people to see. We have no serviette. It mustn't look strange with all this cheese everywhere. - Okay. - So... When no one's looking, we have to... If you're eating together with others, you can just... - Like that. - Okay. And that's too much cheese. - Right ! Slept well ? - Yes, like a log. This food's a bit tedious, but there's at least nothing wrong with it. - Jens ? Are you afraid of germs ? - Me ? No, no. For today's exercise Shanti will also be turning up. - How nice. - Great ! Shanti's good. He's perfect ! You don't need to be scared of me. Deep inside me, there's a scared little boy. And when I look at you, I see myself. Do you understand ? I see your fear. That's my fear, too. You're so very beautiful ! - I don't know if I... - What ? What don't you know ? - If you're mocking me. - Why would I be mocking you ? Jens, in this situation you wouldn't dare look straight into Michael's eyes. You want to be close, but you're afraid he'll see that you aren't beautiful. - That I'm disgusting, even ? - Yes. You're petrified he'll just feel repulsed. And my goal, is that still... What is my goal ? - You want recognition. - I want recognition. I want recognition, too. What I'd actually love is for you to give me recognition. Could you change places ? Then, let's see if you can give me some recognition. Why don't we start with you giving me a compliment ? Just like that ? - Vera ? - Stop wriggling out of things. - I'd like Vera... - You're not great at compliments, eh ? Vera, this is yours... Hi. You... have an attractive force that's bloody amazing. You're also very sexy. And a little dangerous. I like that. No. No, this... I'd like Shanti to do this. The more reflective side of me. Yeah. How does it feel ? Actually... Mikael ? I need some help with this. I need a script. Think of what we're good at. What you like. Then go for it ! \"For women, love is more than appetite A sensation of the tongue more than the heart That appetite may sicken from excess But mine is no less voracious than the sea And melts the same, so don't compare The feeling a woman may have for me With the feeling I harbour for you.\" That's one way of doing it. So, what else do you like ? In your own words. Coming from you. Okay. No, I really think I need a script. Just say: \"First, there's Thalia. Then, there's my wife.\" - \"First, there's Thalia.\" - \"Then, there's my wife.\" - \"Then, there's my wife.\" - It's an exercise ! Could you just focus on me ? To hell with Thalia. - In what ways do you feel loved ? - You know... People think I only want one thing, but I'm actually interested in women's inner lives. - Sex isn't everything. - And I know that. I know you have these two sides, and that's why I like you, but... - Your depth just isn't as... - I'd like to paint you. - Now. - Okay. How would you like me to sit ? Or lie ? - Like this ? - Lie any way you want. I think this is where Thure steps in. Hi. Thure, pull Vera closer. Closer. And Vera, you keep complimenting him. You've got the most beautiful eyes. You're beautiful throughout. Thure, now you caress Vera's breasts. Vera, take your hand and place it on Thure's dick. Thure ? Unbutton your trousers. Then, you softly press Vera's face against your dick. What the fuck ? What the fuck's happening ? I just felt a bit queasy. It's... Is it because of us ? Are you sabotaging this on purpose, or what ? I've never felt ill from that. At least not while it's happening. God, how unprofessional can you get ? Jens ? - Now I can't continue. Can you ? - He's okay. Who gives a fuck ? - He is, though. - Sabotaging a scene is unprofessional. - We're trying to focus on our job ! - Something caught in his throat. - Well, I'm trying to work here ! - Is it... Yeah ! Fucking amateur ! So, you knew that ? So, why do we need sex in all of this ? Why are you so set on fucking ? There's actually something I'd like to say, if that's alright ? - Please do. - It's about you, Trine. I can see that when you're sitting there broaching the topic of fucking, you start leering. That makes me want to tell you that we've agreed to keep within certain boundaries and stay in character. - Unbelievable ! - What is ? Hell, I work the way I work ! - Do you really ? - Yes ! I'm always in character ! - I'm here to work. Or, we all are. - Yes. Exactly ! And then, if I'm honest, I think it's crap that you can't do your job ! - For fuck's sake ! - Are you pissed off ? Why do you suddenly play cop ? That's totally not in character. And my verdict is that this is totally in line. Well, this is also totally in line, so who's out of order ? So, what's it like, working with me ? Honestly, now. -Well, I... I like it. - Oh ? - What's your feeling ? - I don't know. Yes, I like it, too. - You do ? - Yes. - That's great. - But... I don't mean but, but... Wouldn't it be good if we were totally honest with one another ? - Yes. - And then... Well... Okay, I would... I love children. I love being close to children. - I think it's... - Okay ? And... Well, I'm feeling a bit panicky. I'm a bit stressed. I mean, I have loads of dates. I sleep with loads. But then, I get bored and then I leave. I leave relationships because it just gets too... boring. Do you get me ? But I want children. I do want a child. Okay. So, I was thinking that... Maybe you and I could have a baby ? A kind of... - As part of this film. Naturally. - Of course. Yeah. - You mean... ? - Sure. - I'm in. - It would be an art baby. - Yes. - And I would have a child. - Sure. - I'd be so happy. Count on me. Hang on, are you really... Do you get... ? - Do you get what I mean ? - Definitely. - So, how were you picturing it ? - Well, kind of... - If... - We'd have to... - Seriously. What's your idea ? - Seriously, we'll have to... I assume we'd start by seducing one another. Wouldn't we ? - How does that sound ? - That sounds smart. - Really smart. - Let's do it for real. Okay. And how do you envisage the outcome ? For you, in your private life ? At home ? - What would your wife say ? - But... I'm not really sure that I've made any kind of realistic analysis of the consequences. I can't claim that. No, I can kind of tell. I can tell, so... - I'm actually serious. - So am I. No. You're acting. No. This is reality. So, you take no responsibility for reality outside of here ? This is reality. We're playing with reality and fiction. You're an artist. I'm an artist. The ultimate combination of you and me is to have a child. An art baby. Hang on ! I don't really know if I... You're talking about the film ? If so, I'm all in. I thought you were saying that you wanted a baby with me in real life ? - Yes. - You want to have a baby with me ? Do you want a baby with Mikael Persbrandt ? Yes... Or, I mean... My thoughts were... Of course, I can't sit here, as the director, and ask you to impregnate me. So, you don't want a baby with me ? - I do want a baby. - You want a baby ? But I am... I thought that since we're playing with reality and fiction anyway, why don't we just play with that idea, too ? This baby will be an art baby, so when I care for it, I'll be making art. Hang on, I really need to ask you: Is this something that happens in the film ? Or are we talking about your private life ? - In the film... - Right now, we're working. - Then, it's a great idea. - Yes ? I seem to keep misunderstanding you. I kept thinking that you actually wanted to have a baby with me. Or even worse, with Mikael Persbrandt. - No, what I'm imagining is... - You don't want a baby with me ? - I wouldn't say no. - You want a baby with me ? No ? Yes ? She wants to have an art baby with me ! - An art baby ? - Yeah. We'll have sex, make a baby. For real. In this film. At least within the framework of the film, but still a real child. Just imagine her coming to you ! - No thanks. - What would your reaction be ? I really don't know. I don't know how to... Do you feel a sense of responsibility ? - That's the one ! - Mikael ? Can I ask you, Mikael: What happens if you just have one small drink ? I feel no need to do that. Why do you ask ? - Just curious. - Do you find it provocative ? Well, I for one find it a fucking shame when someone can't even have one glass. Anna, it's wonderful that you're in such a good mood. Tell us more about your methods. When will we start filming ? I want to know that, too. When will we start ? - You know what we're doing, don't you? - Yes, but I've been in loads of films. And a production plan is always a great thing. - Oh, leave her alone. - Don't worry about them. We're meant to be having fun, and that includes you. Thanks for tonight. Okay, I'm off to my room. Know that I'm with you all the way, no holds barred. I'll do whatever the fuck you want me to do. Can you grab that ? Right, now Christmas can come again ! - Bloody hell ! - Damnation ! - Do you know what that was ? A shock ! - Did it hurt ? - Lie there. - Okay. - But, hey... - A cushion ? Sure. I'll get you one. No, that's too fast. No, lie still. Don't move ! I'm doing that massive dick I wanted to do. There. - What's it like ? - Nice ! - Thanks ! Thank you, Mikael. - My pleasure. I'd like to start by welcoming our new alter egos. Shanti, you were around earlier, but an extra warm welcome to Sofie. Why don't you start with a brief introduction ? I'm Sofie Gråbøl, and I'm portraying Anna's logical and artistic side. - And intelligent. - And intelligent. Wasn't that obvious? My name's Shanti Roney, and... I'm playing Mikael's... creative and theatre-loving side. I'd even like to claim that the theatre saved my life. Yes. - Nice. - Cheers. - Enjoy ! And see you ! - Cheers. Cheers. Thure ? I heard things got a bit wild last night. Anna and Thure tattooed one another. - Seriously ? - Show us. Nothing big... War marks ! This is nice. I mean, I made it. - No... Cheers ! - Let's drink to tattoos ! Cheers, Mikael ! Right, now when we're all gathered, I feel it's a good time to ask... Anna ? What are we doing here ? What is it we are doing ? This is yours. As you know, the thing we're trying to shed some light on here is who we are. Who we have been, and who we'd love to be. We're trying to reach the most essential part of being a human being. Go on. And since we are all artists, we possess enormous potential to actually manage to create something totally amazing in here. We can permit ourselves to create a strong, artistic and provocative film. You never were a present dad 'cause you never could overcome your own angst. But that wasn't the only reason I distanced myself from you. I don't think mum's family ever gave you a chance. And grandma, apparently a good person, was scared of all things different. She made the rest of the family shut you out. Even resent you. When I was little, you were a great man. You were so great, and I so wanted to be that great man. I wanted to be that person who could just leave his family because he found someone even better. Fuck ! I don't even know why I'm here. I don't even know where I am. Maybe all I needed was to see how small you really are, and I see that now. You are so small. I've always felt the lack of a father. Like a vast hole inside. Constantly looking for recognition. I can't really say that I've been that present in my own children's lives. But now, I am trying to be. Now, I'm doing my best. Do you remember calling me a whore ? I'd just been up to see my brother who was ill, and... You stopped the car when you saw me walking from the hospital. You lowered the window, told me I looked like a whore, raised it and drove off. Do you know why I wore so much make-up that I looked like a whore ? I couldn't cope with the fact that I looked like you. For years, I was obsessed with the idea that you should die. I had decided I was going to kill you. I checked out rifle clubs to get access to a weapon. But I never got that far. I ended up in a mental ward. Sure, it would have been easier for me if I had refrained from protesting so hard against your weird ideas about order. I don't get it. Is she saying that... If we'd behaved differently, he would have, too ? Is she blaming us ? She's probably thinking that he'll be able to accept his part of the blame if she helps him carry it. Should a child carry the blame for a parent who can't control his temper ? - No. Sit down. Sit down ! - \"It was a huge mistake. That I was born human. The way things are, I will always be a stranger, incapable of feeling I belong in any group or community. Someone who always has to be somewhat in love with death.\" Dad, a friend of mum's said they saw you in the audience once. When I was performing at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. I wish you'd told me what you thought. I know I was bloody good. Hello ! Do you think you can lie there and hide because you're ill ? No need to answer because you're ill ? Is that your excuse ? I really just want us to talk to one another. Just say something. I really need it ! Have you ever loved me ? Have you ? How could you accuse mum of spoiling us with too much love ? Did you love me like your other family ? A child can never have too much love. I'd never, ever do what you have done to me ! Why are we doing this ? Well ? What's it good for ? Surely this can't be part of the film ? Anna ! Could you come ? We want to ask something. - Anna ? - Anna ! Yes ? What is this ? I felt both you and I have been affected by our relationships with our dads and that they are important in having shaped us as we are today. But surely you understand that we can't include this in the film ? I think it's best to stay with yourselves rather than look at your families. Exposing them can be pretty aggressive. But Mikael, we'd never include anything you can't actually stand for. - Nothing we can't stand for ? - Exactly. I see. Then, why is this in it ? You're criticising my methods in front of the other actors. Not at all ! We've arrived at these methods together. Maybe we have, but I still don't get... - Vera ? Thure ? Could you come in ? - Great ! Bring them in, too. You and I went into this project, fully prepared to bare ourselves. But hell knows if you actually have any depth. I suspect you don't. All there is, is... Attitude. Nothing else. When we started this project, you were large. Grandiose. You were interesting! - Do you know what they say about you ? - No, tell me. - That you're mad. - I'm mad ? - You are ! You're insane. - Insane ? Do you know... Vera ? You're oppressing me. And I know why. - You have to... - You're afraid of me now, aren't you ? - Does it look that way ? - Hey ? Are you ? Are you afraid ? - We're alone here. No one else. - That's got nothing... - You're so fucking empty ! - What does that do to you ? You're so fucking... So fucking... - This is up. - Okay. I can do... - So, you know how this is done ? - I think it has to go like this. Have you done this before ? Lots of times ? Okay. - I think you're amazing. - It's working ? Wait, wait... Fuck, Micke... We were just testing the wolf costumes. Mikael wants you in the interrogation room. Sit down. Right. So, what do you want ? That's what we want to ask you. What's your objective with this project ? You couldn't ask that yourself ? Everyone in here is asking the same thing. Why not tell us what kind of a film you want, and what you want from us ? I want to tell you that I think we have a problem. - Vera, you don't see me. At all. - Sorry ? You hardly speak to me. You seem to pretend I don't exist. - For me to cope, you have to see me. - I see you. I do see you, Jens, in that way we look at our shameful selves. I see what I can stomach. Maybe I can't stand looking all the time. Your only focus is trying to make an impression on Micke and the team. - But you're a part of us ! - So, that's it ? You think I'm too greedy. I take too much space ? What if it's the other way around ? What if that's you ? You drain every sense of life out of us. Could you just try and see him ? Otherwise, Jens' neurotic side will return, grow and take over completely. We have to recognise the useless, ugly aspects of ourselves, too. That's exactly what I mean. The less you see me, the more the problems will grow. But Jens, Vera is really struggling to keep us up. Precisely. Support her in her search for pleasure. Everything can't be 100 per cent correct all the time. I work with uncertainty. And I don't. Sure, an actor can use his uncertainty. All he needs to know is for what. We need something to refer to. If you could let go, embrace this and challenge yourselves, we'd have a... - \"The script is coming.\" - You need one, don't you ? I need a script ! To enable you not to just be a copy-cat. If you hadn't been so scared of trying a different method, we'd have got a hell of a lot further. - Yeah... - And then, this thing with the eyes. You do it all the time. It does add... To the feeling that you're mad. She can't help what she looks like, for fuck's sake ! I think your eyes are nice. Shanti, we're the same person. - On the same side. - All of us are on the same side. She's leaving. That's your fault. Hey, you've gone to bed without me ? - We can't wait for you all night. - You left me on my own out there. You could have asked us to come. We're not mind-readers. Come on. Not many people have such cushy lives that they're paid to sleep. That would be those who work in care homes, maybe. What's that supposed to mean ? You're supposed to carry my self-loathing, not rub me in it. - What ? I don't understand. - You're calling this a madhouse. No, I only said that people working in care homes get paid to sleep. Sensitive as a steam roller. God - when he finally says something almost funny. - Put the light out ! - Do you think I had fun with them ? Anna, just get to bed and sleep. I have to talk to you. - To me ? - Oh, my God, let's leave. - Bye ! - Good luck. Being totally honest... Shouldn't I, or any of the other alter egos, be a little more nuanced ? I feel we just become one huge ego. With Shanti somewhere on a limb. I honestly can't see him in you. Your soft, reflective side simply isn't credible. I can see you in what Thure and I do, but how can Shanti get even a chance with nothing real to go on ? I think he's doing a good job. I think he's lurching around like a blind man. He defended Anna. That was real. Why are you even in this film ? I'd love to know. - I think it'll be a bloody good one. - How the hell can it be ? You aren't giving your alter egos what they need to do your deconstruction ! Maybe Anna's correct ? Maybe it's not about her at all. - You're in this to clear your name. - Shut up. This is wrong ! Your job is to stick to the analysis and the constructive part. - Get it ? - Oh, I do. I'm being you. I'm you and nothing else all the time. Okay, but I don't recognise myself. What a laugh ! You don't see you in me ? No. Well, fuck me ! - I see myself more in Shanti. - Can I say something ? Self-awareness. Yes... I feel like masturbating. This suddenly became very interesting. Okay... Stop that, for fuck's sake ! There's nothing in my contract about having to take part in sexual games. That crossed her limits. I always thought you were bloody rigid. This is a fucking violation ! You don't respect any boundaries at all ! Artistic boundaries don't exist. Blocked people do and in abundance in here. Do you know what your problem is ? An inability to distinguish between no limits and art. Show me your amazing fucking genius ! The sole reason why we're all here. That which is the artist I was under the impression I'd be playing ! Good morning. Hello. Where's Anna ? -She's maybe a bit upset. - And perhaps also a bit oversensitive. - Has something happened ? - Has something happened ? Is there any meaningful communication between you and your director ? - Of course. - Yes, that's pretty obvious. And you have no idea of what's happening ? Indeed. Yesterday, she said she'd got first-rate material and can finalise the script. Finalise ? Or start writing it ? Or what ? I think it has been very interesting being part of this unusual project, but it is of the utmost importance that we, in time, before the next stint... That we get access to a script well before that time. Anna ? As an actor, I need one to be able to deliver. I think that you and Sofie, who came into the process a little late, haven't quite understood how I work. Sorry to ask, but is this an assessment ? Can I say what I want ? Then, I'd like to say, as Jens... The first thing Mikael and I said when you moved into this studio was that in here, you never step out of character. He has to be allowed to say how he feels. You obviously haven't understood at all what we've agreed to do in here ? No worries. It was only a question. Our Danish participants have a plane to catch, so quickly, before you leave... Thank you. Thanks. There she goes. Thank you for being amazingly brave and throwing yourselves into this rather unique project with your hearts, souls and with all your competence. Many thanks. You'll get a script, like you asked for, Shanti. In good time before next time. - In two months' time. - Okay. I've just spoken to Sofie's agent who maintains that Sofie won't be back. Doesn't our agreement require her to come back ? After what happened that last night, we're not in a position to argue. For heaven's sake ! If we report her for breach of contract, they'll sue you for sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances. How huge a creative block is it possible to exhibit ? All I did was explore my sexual frustration. But Sofie perceived it differently. Think about it, though. Wouldn't it be exciting from a marketing perspective: \"Artist reported for sexually harassing herself.\" Anna, how's the script coming along ? I need a room in the studio to finish the script in. - You promised to have it done. - It's only for one single scene. Use one of the psychologist's rooms. - Hello ? -Were you sleeping ? No. Or yes. Do you know what time it is ? I've decided that I want your reactions to the script to be part of the film. - Anna... - You get it once we're in the studio. Seriously, we need to know what kind of film we're producing. Your mistrust has jeopardised this project. If you'd been less anxious, we wouldn't have had to delay the filming 5 months. You know why there's a 3-month delay. There's no script. It'll be 5 months when we get back. Let's talk about this tomorrow. My family's sleeping. Just go to bed. This script is going to be... Hello ? Peter ? Shit. We're back. - Hello. - Gosh ! - Welcome. - Wow, you've been busy. Hi. - Hi, Trine. - Hi there. - Hi, Jens ! Welcome ! - Hello. - Hello, you. - So... Congratulations, then. - Is that the little art baby in there? - Maybe so. - Yes ? A real art baby ? - Well done. Where are Sofie and Shanti ? Sofie couldn't make it, and we can't have an uneven number. I'll just pop over and have a look at the room. Oh, well. Nice to see you all again. Oh, what's this, then ? How far gone are they ? Five-six months ? - I don't know. Could they be ? - They are well into it. Of course, women vary in size, but... So, she'll have her art baby. I bet you it's what she always wanted. Shall I find out ? Whether they're yours ? Yes. - So, how's it going ? - Well, thanks. And how are you down in the studio ? It's about Mikael. It's not very good. Because of the pregnancies ? Yes. The situation's gotten very tense. - I'm concerned it'll get out of hand. - You mean... Like he'll drink and... Speak out ! Are you concerned he'll start drinking and doing drugs ? Of course I am ! Alcohol, drugs, all that shit ! The lot. That he sinks into the depths. I understand. Okay. So... What ? What do you mean, what ? He's afraid Anna'll tell the press he's the father. I understand. Bearing his family in mind and all... Both you and I know that baby is not his. Not his, no... How can we be sure ? - So, she hasn't said anything to you ? - No. There was talk about art babies earlier, but after she got pregnant, she hasn't spoken about it at all. ...a different level. It's a totally different level. She should be working with amateurs. She's dealing with the best Nordic actors around. She should go home, have the baby and not come back until she's got a proper script. A real director knows what she wants. Has a sense of direction. And status. I wouldn't have accepted if I knew I was playing an idiot ! - Holy shit ! - Sorry. I'm sorry. - Just don't tell anyone about this. - You're not pregnant ! No. She wanted us to do this. Believing in things would give an authentic feel. So, she wanted all of you to believe that we were pregnant with an art baby each. - Shit... - So, she's not pregnant either ? - This is sick ! - Yes. - This is not funny. - No. It isn't funny. Good morning ! - Morning. - Good morning. - How are you, Jens ? - Fine, thanks. Sometimes, I seriously doubt what we're doing. We've got food and drink. We're well looked after. Who cares ? What's your view, Mikael ? Say something, dammit ! I'm just amused that you're so upset. - Oh, you're not ? - No. I'm relieved. That I haven't made anyone pregnant. - What ? - Yes ? - Sorry, Vera. Clumsy of me. - What's this ? - Are you not pregnant ? - No. - What ? - I can't believe it ! You're seriously not going around faking being pregnant ? - Are you ? - Leave her alone. Don't you see how mental this is ? Anna's trying to scare you. - True, she is. - And she's fucked you all ! Is there anyone with a dick who hasn't fucked Anna ? - I paid her a visit once, but... - Jens ? Goddammit, Jens ! It is totally sick. Totally insane. - Today, we're doing an exercise... - Anna. The object of which is that our alter egos will talk about our innermost feelings. Through you, we will become the truest versions of ourselves. Or that we could potentially be. Jens - just imagine not having to feel afraid any more. Or that you don't need to be worried about being nobody. Are you serious ? - What is it you don't get ? - What I don't get ? Listen... Now, you're crossing every line. Totally and utterly. You're over the top. Totally off-piste. Do you realise I'm two seconds from leaving this project ? - Two seconds ! - Trine ? Calm down. Come with me. We need to talk. I know what I'm doing. As an artist, a human being and a director. But obviously not as an actor. - You needn't pretend to be pregnant. - I never pretend ! Shut up. I want all of you to understand that it's vital that we can show ourselves naked to each other. Everything we do in here carries meaning. - I have nothing to hide from you. - Okay. Tomorrow, you will all get full access to the entire script. It's going to be fucking brilliant. And tonight, we're going out to celebrate. Need help ? - Hiding something ? - It'll all be revealed in due course. Please excuse me. Had you been less damn full of yourself, this art film could have been off the ground ages ago. Oh, I see. This is an art film we're doing ? Call it what you want. Is your art baby part of this great piece of art ? Will we know who's the father when we watch this art film ? Will we ? When did you last fuck Mikael ? Ask yourself. Sure, but there are plenty of us here. Hell knows what side you've been fucking. You're insane ! What's she saying ? No one takes any responsibility for this production. No one's accountable. This fucking production lacks adults ! - No... What's she saying ? - She's insane. - Okay. - She's damaged. Deranged for real. What do I do now ? You shouldn't sit there and take it. Should you ? You should talk to the producer and show him who's boss. You'll go straight to him and tell him what you think about all this. I will ! You're a fucking arse of a producer ! Aren't you ? Come here. Here. - Should I... - Go ahead. Isn't it great breathing fresh air ? Eight, please. And two non-alcoholic ones as well. Here you go. And one for Anna. I think there's one missing over there. Enjoy it while you can. Tomorrow we'll get our much longed-for script. Let's drink to that ! - Cheers. - Cheers ! I can have two. Do we drink a toast in Danish or Swedish ? Anna's prepared something tomorrow for the script presentation. Sounds exciting. A great big bonfire in the parking lot. She asked me to get two cans of petrol. - She asked you for two cans of petrol? - Yes. - Do you realise she's back there now ? - To prepare for tomorrow. Have you read the script ? Anna ! You were born. And so you are free. So happy birthday.

I'm done. I'm not done. Finish. Finish. What? You're not into it. Mark. Yeah. Do you want talk about what happened tonight? What? You have nothing you want to say? No. I wanna check my emails and I want to go to bed. I gotta meet Todd really early in the morning. What was that, tonight? What? You yelling across the restaurant? I heard you say, \"Dicks, pussy, licking, asshole,\" all in one sentence. And so did everybody else. Babe, there was nobody else sitting near us in the restaurant. What is it that you are trying to prove? I don't have anything to prove. It was a joke. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't like it when you act like that. It is embarrassing to me. You didn't have to make it really awkward, 'cause everyone felt awkward. Okay, you know what, I'm gonna go to sleep. Maybe we can talk about this sometime tomorrow, but, you know what, I... I have to sleep. Are you unhappy? Are we seriously gonna keep doing this? I wanna know. Babe, I'm happy. I don't feel like you're happy. I'm happy. Do I make you unhappy? Honestly? Do you really wanna know? Yeah. Yeah, sometimes you make me unhappy. I knew it. What? Do you wanna sleep on the couch, or should I? You're not sleeping on the couch. Then you go. I'm not sleeping on the couch either. Fine. What are you doing? You're not gonna fucking sleep on the couch! Then you go. No. Well, I'm not sleeping in bed with you. I don't want to be near you. Well, what do you want me to do? You want me to leave? Is that what you want me to do? Sure! You want me to fucking leave? If that's what you want. Go. Fine. I'll go. ♪ What are you doing? I'm looking at Facebook. You want some tea? Sure. Yeah, that'd be great. Mark. What? I don't know how to say this. I slept with Jason. You what? I slept with Jason. When? When you were out of town. Why, Sylvia? I feel alone. All the time. What am I supposed to do about it? I don't know, talk to me about it? I try to talk to you. I try to talk to you all the time. You don't want to talk to me! I tried. You don't even want to listen to me. [Kettle whistling] [Car horn honking] [Phone vibrating] That gonna work for you? Yeah, this is good. Thank you. I'm gonna head out in a bit and get awake. You wanna join? No, I'm fine. I gotta meet Todd really early in the morning. Well, dude, take the bed while I'm gone. Seriously. I'm gonna be gone for a minute. Don't worry, it's clean. All right, well, there's plenty of food and drink in the fridge. Help yourself. Thanks, Jake. I really appreciate it. No problem. I'll see you in a bit. [Alarm blaring] Morning, dude. Hey. Good morning. [Shower running] I love the new script. It's a beautiful world you've set up. I mean, it needs some work, but it's getting there. I have some questions. Okay, cool. Now, you have one character that's going to be played by three different actors. Yes. Why? Um... well, I mean, it's about-- it's about growth. It's about how he evolves as a person. It's about how he sees himself as a different person, in each different stage of his life. Okay. I don't think it makes sense, but you seem to think it's a good idea, so I'm confused. Yeah, I really think it can work. And the, um, cross-cutting of the stories, don't you think it would be a lot easier if it were told linearly? A lot easier to follow, you know, told in order? Well, yeah, I think it would be a lot easier to follow, yeah. Um, but, I don't think it would be very interesting. I have a secret for you. I showed it to Warner Brothers. You showed it to Warner Brothers? I just wanted to give them a taste. It's not ready. Why would you do that? You said you weren't going to do that. I know, I know, but the point is, they're excited. They're really, really excited. They love the idea. They're looking for a high concept sci-fi for a summer release. They think this could be huge. They think this could be the one. Really? They really like it? Yeah, but they have some concerns. Okay, what kind of concerns are you talking about? Big concerns? Small concerns? Well, they're concerned about three actors playing one role and the fucking cross-cutting of the stories bullshit. They also need you to end with a big chase sequence. Wow. Okay, that's some real shit. Look, if you want to do a movie for an audience of five hipsters in Williamsburg, you go right ahead. I'm not in the business of making crap, okay? You have a great idea. We can make something epic here. [Phone honking] Do not fuck it up with this \"I went to film school so I have to make art\" bullshit. Fuck, I have five more meetings today, and then I gotta catch a 10:00 flight. Tiffany's ovulating and I gotta get the juice in her before her eggs dry up. She's got it down to a science, it's like a five-hour window. It's fucking... it's fucking a chore. Listen, I'm back in a week. You think you can get those changes by then? Yeah, I think I can do that. YOGA INSTRUCTOR: Stretch your fingertips towards your big and second toe. Push the right hip more forward. Tuck in the chin. With your eyes only, look up towards your right thumbnail. Grow a little bit. You got a little bit more. Stretch up. Reach up. There it is. This is how you become stronger. Lift up, stretch up, and hold it here. Hold it here. Charge your body forward. We all have windows of opportunity. No hesitation. Only awareness. Stretch your finger just more forward. Kick your foot back, as you kick the toes all the way up. Bellies engaged tight. Start to bring your body down. Your chest down, all from the lower spine. ♪ Tessa! My little pony's coming! [Dog barking] Shut up, dogs! Here. Hey. Jesus. Oh, there she is. Come give me a kiss. Nothing makes me sick, baby. I can't deal with this right now. Just put her on the couch. Okay, let's do this. No. Come on. Dude, you wanna get some water and a trashcan or something? Guy's name is [Unclear]. He's gonna take good care of you. All right. All right. Let's go, come on. Grab my neck. Grab my neck. Come on. Oh-- Ahh! [Laughing] Oh, my god. Tessa! You're drunk. Okay. No, you're a mess. I just wanna make you happy. Okay-- no. I'm not in the mood. Shh... Stop. Seriously. You're a mess. I don't like being with you when you're like this. [Laughing] Ahh... I actually don't need you. You can go. You're a fucking drunk. Just get your shit together, Stacy. Let's get you up. It's okay. [Snoring] Hey... No, I had, like, two interviews last week, and one of them went really well. He really liked my portfolio. He was just like, \"You have a lot of cool style.\" And... I don't know... Yeah, I'm doing, like, a lot of yoga, been working on my, like, meditation, and I'm feeling really good, and I'm feeling positive, like it's totally gonna happen. I'm fine! I have a budget. Really. All right, well, how's Dad? Can I talk with him? Okay, no, I get it. Hi. Hi. What can I get you? Uh... What do you suggest? Uh, well, the Flores is very good, but my favourite is the Kogomini from Kenya. Kogomini! Kogomini. Sounds fancy. It's got a really nice floral undertones. Uh, it's sweet with, uh, hints of syrup, and it goes down smooth and finishes strong with a trace of chocolate. Wow. That sounds delicious. I'll have two, please. Okay, good choice. It'll be $18. Wow. Shit. They better be good. Thanks. There's your change. Hey! Hey. Hi. Can I get you anything else? Do you have any brown sugar? Yeah, it's right over there. Oh, yeah. Next to the white sugar. That's right. Uh, anything else? Uh, yeah... This... is for you. Do you want me to throw it out? No. Um, inside-- there's something inside if you're interested. No, no, not right now. Not now! Oh! Jen. Yeah. Okay, bye! Bye... Hey! You left this. Oh! Thank you! You're welcome. I'm sorry. I'm such an ass. I saw you and I was like, \"Eh, why not? What the fuck?\" You know? Um, but I don't do this on a regular, or, like, at all. That's okay. So you can tear it up, you can throw it away, you can clean up coffee with it, um, whatever. Okay. Okay. I think I'm gonna go now. Um, should I give you, like, a reward or something? No, I mean, like, I hardly found it, so don't worry about it. Okay, well, thank you. All right. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Hi. I'm late. I got caught up at work. On a Sunday? Yeah, we're slammed. Got a lot to do. Thank you! Mani mani! Jen, you don't have a job. Why are you getting manis? It was nothing. It was cheap. Did you pick this colour? She suggested it. Ugh, you don't like it. No, it looks great. I like it. It makes me smile. Good! WOMAN: Ready now? Yeah, we're coming. No waiting. Now or no \"scrubbu\". No scrubbu. [Laughing] Let's go. JEN: I had a vodka soda and he had two more pilsners. And then I had a cosmo, and he had two more pilsners. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Can you look at me? Jen, I can hear you. Hi. Hi. He sounds like a winner. I really felt a connection. What happened to... Don? Doug? Don? Doug? Oh, yeah, Doug. What happened? I stopped calling him. He just wanted to do me, like, all the time. Oh, who says \"do me\"? He wanted to do me. To do me, like all-- like, literally all the time. And I was like, it's not even that good, so. I cut that cord. Really? 'Cause I thought you said you liked him. Okay, well, maybe he stopped calling me. [Both laughing] Oh, my god... I'm so fat! You're so ridiculous! Johnny, he's just so cute. He's just-- He's like tall, and he's like not the kind of guy that I would normally be into, but you know, maybe a change is good. Maybe I need a change. Maybe I need to just, like, do something that's, like, out of the ordinary. Maybe then it will work, you know? Oh, my god, I forgot to tell you, I met, like, the cutest, cutest guy at the coffee shop. Like, you guys-- like, you talked to him? Well, sort of. What do you mean? Well, I ordered coffee. And then? And then I asked for some sugar, and then I, like, slipped him my number on a piece of paper, the napkin. On a napkin, like you're in junior high? Yeah! No, well, he thought it was really cute, 'cause he gave me his number too. And there were all these people on the train, at 5:00 in the morning, and I was like, \"Where is everybody going?\" To work. To work? Yeah. I was like, \"I need to be amongst the working class.\" Yeah, you do. That's where I want to be. You know? Like everybody was together on the train, they were heading somewhere. Revelations. Well... You should start looking for a job. It's been like three weeks, right? Yeah. I need a moment. I just need to get myself together. Okay, I guess that's the responsible thing to do. Are you okay? Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong? Jen. No. It has nothing to do with you. I've just been having a really rough week. Do you want to talk about it? So... Mark and I are not speaking. What? He moved out. What happened? Well... we weren't communicating, and then last weekend I just realized that he's a child, and he doesn't want to grow up, so... I mean, I can't live like that. Okay, I need a lot more details than that. You can't just drop that one on me. Well, I confronted him about being loud at the restaurant last weekend. You were there. You saw him. He was being a complete asshole. Oh, it was me who made that thong joke. I thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. I thought it was. Okay, why would you even say that, Jen? What? You're just gonna take his side. You don't even know the rest of the story yet. No, I'm not. It was a joke, and I thought it was funny. Well, I thought it was embarrassing. So that's why he left? Because of a joke? You guys couldn't figure that out? No. Well, yes, but he was leaving before that. I told him about Jason. Oh, my god. You didn't. Yes, I did. I just said I did. He must've flipped. No, he didn't. That's the point, Jen. He doesn't talk. He didn't want to talk about it. How am I supposed to live with someone like that? Mark is a good guy. And he loves you. I mean, he has every right to be upset. So, what, you think that this is all just my fault? He's got no responsibility? Sylvia, you did fuck up. It's more complicated than that, Jen. Relationships are complicated. I think I know about relationships. Oh, really? 'Cause when was the last time you were in one? I haven't found a guy that's good enough. Okay, well, I don't think that's the problem, but whatever. Relationships take work. That's not really something you understand. Okay, I wouldn't understand? I'm not the one who just fucked up my relationship of six years. I may not know what it's like to be in a long-term relationship, but I do know that it requires respect. Respect? Yes. Oh, you mean like the kind of respect you get when you sleep with a guy on the first date? Don't talk to me about respect, Jen. Please, go. Are you serious? I'll take that. No, it's fine. I don't want your money, okay? Okay. Fine. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you, or something. Bye. It's Johnny, leave a message. Hey, do you mind if I smoke, please? Cool, thanks. [Knocking] [Knocking] Can I help you? Uh, yeah, is Johnny here? Who are you? Who are you? I'm his wife. Oh... Oh. Uh, can I help you? No, I just thought that I would stop by and say hi. I was in the neighbourhood. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh... How do you two know each other? We, uh, we went to college with each other. Yeah, we were in school together. Hamilton. All right, you know what? He's not my friend. Actually, we met on OKCupid, and we went out on a date last night, and I came up here to get my bag. I am so sorry. He did not tell me that he was married. Can I just have my bag? What? What do you mean, what? Go get her bag. I'm so sorry. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. I did. In my bed? I didn't know it was your bed. Do you have an STD? No! No, I am clean. I'm absolutely clean. Good, because I have a mild case of herpes, and so does Johnny. I hope you get it. Excuse me. Here.

Two sides, two points of view clash in apocalyptic strength, in a struggle that will tear the world apart and destroy the lives of many. Kakyou's love was the first casualty. Now, comatose and wishing only for death so he can join his beloved, he watches as the gears of fate begin to turn, and the soldiers of destiny march towards doom...", "content": "I see a dream. I see the future inside my dreams. The two holy swords. It is also said that two \"Kamuis\" appeared. I'm Kakyou. An earth dragon, one of the seven angels. A seer, who sees the future in dreams. Where am I from? Why am I able to see the future? And what meaning does this have? Everything means nothing to me now. Everything has already been lost. At that time.. With the person I loved so much. Right there.. Please let me do this. Hokuto.. You shouldn't have come here.. If you come here.. You will be.. .. Dead! You cannot.. Don't come here.. What I saw in my dream.. Will come true. Hokuto.. Run.. Kakyou.. Why.. Why? Hokuto.. Madam.. It's over. He is dead? I believe it's just a matter of time. I understand. Do what you can for him. Yes. That boy.. He was born with the power to see the future in his dreams. This was his painful fate. Everything is over. Ended. Huh? Where am I? This is not my dream.. This means.. That this is your dream? Correct. This is my dream. Why was I able to enter your dream? Why? Because I wanted to see someone. Because I was alone all this time. I would like to see.. Someone. See someone? So would anyone be fine? You can't be saying that.. With a beautiful girl like me in front of you! Who are you? A prophet, perhaps? That's what I thought. I heard.. That there are people who can see the future in their dreams. Are you surprised that I know? I grew up in a family of paranormals. Ever heard of the Sumeragi clan? My little brother is the leader now. I don't know how to use most spells. Talentless, I think. But, having little power, I got to know him this way. My name is Hokuto Sumeragi. What is yours? Kakyou. Kakyou Kuzuki. Kakyou, huh? So why are you alone all the time? Didn't you leave there too? Is that why you wanted it yourself? It's not? So it's easy! I will take you somewhere. Where would you like to go? To anywhere. This is not worth it! Because it's our first date! I would like to see the sea. The sea? How about a sea like this? This is inside my dream. But the sea in real life is much more beautiful than this one! Since we know each other so well, I want to see you. Not in our dreams, but the real Kakyou. I want to see you too. But.. But? I cannot go out. Never. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go. Now let's go out! Even though I see the future where you die, I couldn't do anything. Not even to protect someone special to me. That was the moment my heart died. I won't do anything else. I can't feel anything. And.. Just sleep.. I will continue to see the future in my dreams. The dream of the tragedy that will happen in the future. I just watch it. The time of a new tragedy is approaching. Guided by destiny.. The dragons of the sky, the seven seals.. .. And the dragons of the earth, the seven angels, will gather. And the one who holds the key to the fate of the world.. Kamui. With the arrival of this boy, everything would start to move.. Towards a single future. The future is always.. one. No one can change this. All I can do is know the future through my dreams. I can't even save a soul, of so many that will be lost.. In the final battle. Everyone's fate has already been determined. Even if they find.. And hurt.. And love each other. I promised you.. That if anything happened to you, I would protect you. And this will not change either. Never. I had forgotten. You should forget about that too. And never do things you wouldn't do. This is our new promise. Kamui.. I choose you, girl. He chose? If I'm going to choose, I'd rather it be someone beautiful. Choose? What did you choose? The person for whom I will give my life! Am I interfering with your fun? No, I'm done. So tell me, Satsuki. That boy is the real \"Kamui\"? Beast replied yes. I understand. So it has finally started. I'm sure \"Kamui\" won't bother you. Do you smoke cigarettes? It's not good for your health. I've been looking for you all this time. Why? To make my wish a reality. You are one of the sky dragons, trying to save the earth from destruction. I have no interest in the future of the earth. Your wish.. is to kill me? I'm the one who killed your dear sister. You really are adorable, Subaru-kun. It's a good dog. A strange dog, but a good dog. And.. Hey.. Is.. something wrong, young lady? Did I do something bad? This is the first time I know someone who can see my Inuki. Answer me. Why can't we kill humans? Why are humans stronger than other creatures? It's not that! If a creature is stronger, is it okay to kill humans? It's not that. I will ask you one more time. Why can't we kill humans? Answer me. Inuki! It's a difficult question. Poor thing. That sky dragon.. I was going to cry because I didn't have an answer. An answer based on the ethical point of view. An idealistic answer. A biological response. There are many things that can serve as an answer. But none of them are a complete answer. What do you think, Yuto? Well, I think that's probably because.. People would be sad. Nataku, what is your wish? I don't know. But I don't think I'd like to part with you. Why? Because you look like.. my father. What did your father name you? Kazuki. There is no such thing as an emotionless creature. You just think you don't have them. I'm the one who should go. You have a wife and a lovely daughter. Kamui and the other seven seals are still young. But I.. Aoki-san! Do you think no one would cry for you if you died? I would cry. So there really were two \"Kamuis\". An accompanying star born to fill the empty place.. Whichever side, heaven or earth, the true Kamui will choose. Kamui chose to be a sky dragon, one of the seven seals. So the other \"Kamui\" is mine. It's not that.. The \"Kamui\" which is an earth dragon.. .. One of the seven angels, is already nearby. It's not that, Kanoe! Sister, I will prove to you that your premonition was correct. Kanoe! Don't invite \"Kamui\" inside! The earth calls for a revolution. A revolution that humans will not disturb. To do this, we will liquidate everyone who pollutes the earth. Mano.. The tragedy had repeated itself in dreams. This is destiny. Everyone just goes with the flow. There is only one future. One. Is that what you wanted? Yes. Because you had the potential to become a prophet, I could cross into your dreams. We have dreams even at the moment of our deaths. I knew this would happen. But, Even though I know the future, I can't do anything about it. The person who was so dear to me.. Is you.. I couldn't save any of you. Thank you, Kakyou. I have to go now. Kakyou.. If you see my brother and Kamui-chan, please tell them.. That I love them both. And.. That the future has not yet been decided. That the future has not yet been decided.. No. It has already been determined.. The moment I became an earth dragon. You should know that, if you're a prophet. There is only one future. Kakyou. Come with me. And weave dreams for me. For now, I still see the future in my dreams, Even though I know I can't do anything about it. Even so, I still hope.. That the words that girl said to me are true. And also.. That I may once again regain the courage.. That the person I loved so much gave to me. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go. Now let's go out.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X_Yochou-492922", "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/143.0.0.0"},
{"title": "X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) - full transcript", "plot": "Dr. James Xavier is a world renowned scientist experimenting with human eyesight. He devises a drug, that when applied to the eyes, enables the user to see beyond the normal realm of our sight (ultraviolet rays etc.) it also gives the user the power to see through objects. Xavier tests this drug on himself, when his funding is cut off. As he continues to test the drug on himself, Xavier begins to see, not only through walls and clothes, but through the very fabric of reality!", "content": "Now, look right. Left. They're both fine. Retina's clear, muscles are perfect. How is my vision, Doctor? Excellent, Doctor, as we previously tested. Let's sit over here. Why are you really here, James? As I told you, to get my eyes examined. Let's have another look. You had the same examination three months ago. What makes you think your eyes have changed in three months? Nothing. Nothing yet. Then this has something to do with your research. You're planning to experiment upon yourself, aren't you? All right. You're a fine doctor. You know what you're doing. But you only have one pair of eyes. And with them I want to see. You see fine. Sam, what's the range of human vision? - Distance? - No, wavelength. Between 4,000 angstrom units and 7,800 angstrom units. You know that. Less than one-tenth of the actual wave spectrum. What could we really see if we had access to the other 90%? Sam, we are virtually blind. All of us. You tell me that my eyes are perfect. Well, they're not. I'm blind to all but a tenth of the universe. My dear friend, only the gods see everything. My dear doctor, I'm closing in on the gods. Go ahead, Doctor, make a diagnosis. Foreign object. Bullet, it looks like, in the chest cavity. All right. How about this one? Lesion in the heart area, maybe in the lungs. Might be carcinoma. Or a clot. Or just a fog on the plate. Could be any number of things. But what is it, really? Just a shadow play. A pattern to be used for intelligent guesswork. A slight help towards saving the life of the man who made those shadows. Immense help, Dr. Xavier. When you have nothing better, anything is an immense help. That's light. Waves of energy that excite the eye. And the nerve cells transmit this energy to the brain. And with the brain, we see. But there are other forms of energy with different wavelengths. Dr. Xavier, I've read your report. Yes, but do you understand it? Have you any idea what I'm trying to accomplish here? Dr. Fairfax, I'm developing a way to sensitize the human eye so that it sees radiation, up to and including the gamma rays and the meson wind. Yes, I understand. I understood your objective when I first read your report. Then why are you here? Because the report in question was dated nine months ago. Because since that time, you have drawn over $27,000 of the foundation's money and we haven't had a word from you. - Well, there have been problems. - Then report them. To whom, a group of businessmen who can't tell one quantum jump from another? No, to me. The foundation found your research worthy of support. They also appointed me as liaison to these special projects. Listen, Doctor, I've given up my own research to help the foundation and I won't be talked to as if I were a child in kindergarten. I knew of your reputation, but I hadn't heard about your temper. - Now, Doctor... - You want a progress report? I'll give you something better. A demonstration. Come with me. Doctor Morgan... You can be of some help. Put these on. Now, these are hormones, enzymes. Their megalostructures have been slightly altered. Prepare that one in number two, the second cage down. He won't bite you. It's all right. Now, this compound, when used in the eye, increases receptivity. The sensitivity is enormously increased. - Well, you've tried it? - No. Well, you're blunt, Doctor. The monkey's been conditioned, standard pleasure-pain technique. Come on. Come on. All right, bring him here. Put him there. Now, when he sees the white, he'll pull the corresponding switch and the light will go on. When he sees the blue, he'll do the same thing and the blue light will go on. And the same thing with the red. Now, watch. Nothing up the sleeves. White, the one he normally sees. But he can't see the blue. It's covered by the white screen. But he does see it. And the red. He sees the red. Well, they're both covered. But don't you understand yet? He sees through them, as if they were glass. What did he see? What did he see? Thanks, Doctor. Can't find a thing. The tissues are fine. The autopsy? Heart failure, nothing else. I'd call it shock. Because of what it saw? No, because it couldn't comprehend or adjust to what it saw or saw through. That's all. No pathology, no degeneration, tissues perfectly healthy. Dr. Fairfax... I think after tonight's work, you can call me Diane. Thank you. I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee. That's the best experiment I've heard all night. You're on, Doctor. Do you take it black? - Yes. - Good. Now, you're a pretty good worker. Why did you give up research and take to moneylending? I don't lend it, I give it away. A million dollars before breakfast every morning. How do your eggs taste then? Flat. You didn't answer my question. I did, in a way. When the foundation picked me for the job, I didn't want it, and then I did. Why? Because it needed somebody who cared, somebody who would support some of the... Well, more untraveled paths. Like mine? James, why do you want to see so much? Well, why do you want to go on breathing? To stay alive. It's much the same thing with me. I'm curious, intensely curious. No, I mean the purpose. How can you use your new vision? There are thousands of ways. You're sitting right on top of probably the most important one right here. In this hospital, there are people I can help. Help by seeing inside them, as if they were windows. By seeing their sicknesses with a clarity that would make X-rays a tool fit only for witchdoctors. Your foundation doesn't like my work, does it? They want you to appear before them the day after tomorrow. I'll be there, and I'll bring them much more than a report. No, it's too dangerous. Then who is going to try it? Some student? Some intern? Yes. Or better yet, some convicted murderer. Anyone who has less to lose than you. And how are they going to report it? \"My eyes feel funny\"? \"Gee, Doc, I've got a headache\"? That monkey died. It was a monkey, not a man. - I tell you, no. - Yes. I won't be a party to it. All right. I'll proceed without you. Sam. Sam, I need you. All right. When do you want to do it? Now. August 14th, notes on experiment designated \"X.\" Experimental subject myself, James Xavier. Assisting in experiment, Dr. Samuel Brant. You ready, Doctor? Ready, Doctor. The compound fully described in a written report has been prepared. Dr. Brant will administer one drop into each eye of the subject. One drop. Any choice? Yeah. One in the middle. Tilt your head and look directly up. Well, here it goes, James. Good luck. How long? Eight to 10 seconds. All right, open your eyes. James? It's like a splitting of the world. Vision is fragmented. More light than I've ever seen. Filled with light. I have to close them. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm gonna try again. Everything is normal. Wait. Sam, I can see through it. Right through it. \"The exact combination of hormones and enzymes \"is to be determined by analysis.\" Good Lord, Jim. You can! Sam, your lab coat. My coat? There's a pen in your shirt pocket. And there's a button missing under your tie. Sam, it works. It works! I still have just penetrated the surface. My eyes are not quite conditioned yet. But it's a start. Sam, another drop in each eye. Not now. There should be tests. There might be side effects. All right, I'll do it myself. The light! The light! Well, that's the tape, gentlemen. And, of course, the reason Dr. Xavier can't be present today. I've asked Dr. Brant to represent him here. Dr. Xavier has been unconscious since yesterday, when this experiment took place. I've been asked by Dr. Fairfax to speak on his behalf about the continuation of his research funds. Now, you read the reports, you heard the tape of Dr. Xavier's first experiment. I think, gentlemen, you will agree that a fantastic breakthrough is possible. Unbelievable might be a better choice. Dr. Xavier is unable to speak for himself, but his work speaks for him. It can and will be repeated by others besides himself. It is up to this foundation to finance the further work that is necessary. I must confess to you, Doctor, that I don't believe in the continuance of this work. I mean... Well, there still is nothing positive that has come out of it. But, Mr. Bowhead... I'm very sorry, Dr. Fairfax, but I believe our foundation can no longer channel its funds into this work. And that's all. They voted against you. I tried. Dr. Brant. - Sam and I, we've tried. - Everything. They decided to withhold the funds. So, they cut me off like an arm with gangrene. - Maybe they're right. - No, they're wrong. And I'll show them just how wrong. We better leave now. He needs rest. James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow. Bandages? Yes. I hardly noticed them. Hardly noticed them at all. - You'll get your chance again, James. - Yes, I will. I think it's for the best, in any case. You need a rest from research. A return to doctoring will be just the right prescription. - Maybe the hospital could... - No, we've been through it before. We need all our funds just to keep this place going. Well, that's it. I want you in surgery tomorrow. You'll assist me. Why, thank you, Dr. Benson, thank you. It's nice to have you back with us. You might look in on a patient named Stanton in Ward three. I've left the reports and the diagnosis on your desk. Right. May I help you, Doctor? Yes, a patient named Stanton? Yes, right over here. - Thank you. That'll be all, nurse. - Yes, Doctor. He's wrong. The diagnosis is wrong. Doctor? Your eyes. Go back to sleep, dear. Pretty, isn't she? Yes, very. Doctor, I want you to reconsider this operation. Why? You say she has a stenosis. You're wrong. It's a tumor directly in the auricle attached to the valve. Nonsense. The X-rays were taken from every angle. Dr. Benson, I know what I'm saying. You'll be cutting into the wrong area of the heart. Doctor, I shall expect you in surgery at 6:00. I will perform the operation exactly as I outlined it. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, right away. Doctor, someone... Are you all right? Yes, just a temporary headache. - May I get you something? - No. No, thank you. - There's someone waiting for you, Doctor. - All right. I was waiting for you. James, what's wrong? It's nothing. It's just a readjustment. Your eyes. - You're continuing to use the... - Yes, I am. The vision comes and goes. But tonight I saw very clearly, very deeply. And what the devil are you doing here so late? A surprise for you. Bo, not another one. My life's too full of them. Come along. Where are you dragging me? I have young friends who have a cure. For what disease? Intense doctors. Dr. Holmes... About 10 ccs, Doctor. - Exactly. - Beautiful. Beautiful. Be my guest. Here you are, perfect martinis. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ethyl or gin? Well, in deference to your high standings, Doctors, gin. I think I got formaldehyde. - It's been nice talking to you. - It's all right, I love it. Well, are you enjoying yourself? Well, who couldn't around you? My, you're almost romantic. Well, it's just a passing symptom. I don't think I want you cured after all. My dance, Doctor. As one of your ex-students, I have rights. - That'll be all right. - Excuse us. Hi. Hi, I said. Hi. I saw you clear across from over there. Gee, you've got sharp eyes. When I use them. I want you to dance with me. I like the way you look, kind of urgent. I like men who look urgent. - I'll remember that. - Come on. Headache? Headache? No, it's just my eyes. You like the way I dance? It's fine. It's just fine. Jim? My turn, now. - Did you find that fun? - Yes. Yes. - You know, you're quite lovely. - Thank you. Matter of fact, you're very attractive. Well, one drink certainly makes you a different man. Well, you could say I'm really seeing you for the first time. And that's the most interesting birthmark you have above the third rib on your left side. But how do you know that? Why, you can see me. And your backbone's a sheer delight. But remember, I am a doctor. Well, you remember that I'm a woman. I can hardly forget it. Come on, I'm getting you out of here. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, nurse. Good morning, James. Good morning, Doctor. Are you all right? Yes. Perfectly all right. Why do you want me here? I don't know. I think I'm afraid. Diane, what do you know? Only that he's been using the drug again. Ready. Doctor, you must reconsider the procedure. Scalpel. Let go of my hand. Doctor, I shall perform this operation. James, have you gone out of your mind? No, but I want this girl to live. Second blade. I'm going to continue. It seems, Doctor, you are now unable to continue. James, you've gone mad. No. I know exactly what I'm doing. More exactly than any other doctor's ever known before. You think I'm mad? Well, watch. All of you, just watch. You know of my experiments. Dr. Benson knows. What I'm doing is a direct result of those experiments. I can see the heart and the lungs and the internal structures quite clearly. Doctor, we could stop him. No. Swab. All right. You see, Dr. Benson, no stenosis. - Take the patient into recovery. - Yes, Doctor. Dr. Xavier, are you finished? Yes. I'm sorry, there was nothing else I could do, but the girl will live. Dr. Ryan, will you write the postoperative orders? You know what you did was unethical. I had no choice. You realize that news of it has probably spread through the hospital, perhaps even reached the papers. You saw what I've accomplished. I don't know what I saw. But this I do know. You will be tried for malpractice. - Jim. - Diane. - You've got to get away from here. - You're coming with us. Yes, I'm very tired. L, T, N, U, E, X. James. James. Yes, it persists. The effect is cumulative. I see veins, organs, the blood rushing through your heart. I look at Diane, and she appears a perfect, breathing dissection. But, Jim, there must be some way to control it. Of course. Ask your foundation for the money to discover it. We don't need the foundation, any of them. - We'll work together. We'll find a reversal. - No. That's just what I don't want. I'm going on. You can't. I won't permit it. The drug works upon the eyes. - They're the direct route into the brain. - I don't care. What is happening is beyond my hopes. A cumulative effect. Soon, I'll be able to see what no man has ever seen. And, Sam, I want you with me. With new eyes, we'll explore all the mysteries of creation. With knowledge there is power. The power to learn, to create, to do. I proved it today. Jim, who knows what other parts of your mind are affected by this thing. Sam. Jim, it's the only way. Someone has to care for you. Now, push up your sleeve. No! You killed him. - Yes. - Jim. - He was my friend. - You've got to get away. But you saw what happened. They won't believe me, not after the operation. They'll think you're insane. Insane? Insane? Diane, do you... The police. Jim, you've got no time. They'll blame you no matter what we say. One of the most fantastic performances ever to appear here in the carnival show. And you'll enjoy the fabulous things he can do with his fantastic eyes and mind. Hey, you boys over there. You two fellows, step right over here, you're embarrassing the girls. Come on over here and see a show. We're gonna present to you one of the finest shows on earth. Big deal. Hey, buddy, how would you like it if I step on your hands? Nobody likes a wise guy. This man, ladies and gentlemen, he can read your mind. Tell you what you're thinking. Can he tell me where my wife is? Yeah, buddy, on a broom flying around the pier. That's where your wife is. I need guys like you. Come on, you people, he's ready to begin. The man they call Mentallo. The Mentallo, the man with the miraculous mind. Step right up, folks. You're in for one of the greatest, exciting evenings of your life. Good crowd. Yes, I know. All right, everybody. All right, gang. Here he is, Mentallo. Write your thoughts down here and he will read them to you just by pressing them against his forehead. Anything you wanted to write, anything at all. How about my mother-in-law's will? I hope she leaves a picture of your wife, smart guy. Ask him where you get those clothes. The same Army & Navy store you bought yours. Okay? Here's a pencil. Come on, gang. He's a fake. I know how they do this. The first paper he gets is a phony. When he opens the second one to check on it, he's really reading the first. He's one ahead the whole time. Smart. Smart? I heard that, too. Everybody, let's feed the monkeys, so we can go on with the show. All right, pal? You got a thought, or do you wanna sit there and play with your blocks? I could play with your blocks. Here, give him this. Real smart kid. I love those kind of guys. We meet them every time here, but doesn't phase Mentallo. He'll answer every one of them. Here we go. Here you are. This is from a lady who wants to know if I wear this outfit to pin tails on donkeys. See? That's the ringer. That's the ringer, smart guy? What are you, Dick Tracy? How about that, folks? That's exactly what the young lady said. That's right. If the lady will step forward, I will demonstrate. This is from a man who wants to know how much money he has in his pocket. - There it is. - I spent it all to get in here. If the gentleman will stand up, I will tell him. Judging from your appearance, I would say a quarter. This is from a young man who says I am a fake. Would you like a further demonstration of my powers? - It's a trick. - Is it? Your name is John Trask. You've come from Phoenix. You're 27 years of age, you're unmarried. Your social security number is 6-0-9-1-0-6-6-1-4. You have a watch on your person, a gift from your father. How do you know that? You also have a letter in your pocket from a girl you deserted. A girl who loves you. Shut up. This is your trick, ain't it? I have no trick. You gotta. Everybody does. It's in the mask. Can you see through it? No. There's a switch or something. No switch. Then, how? Look, you can trust me. You've been on the pier a month now, and nobody's caught on. You've got something great here. Great. Thank you. In fact, it's so great, I sometimes wonder what you're doing here on the small-time hustle. What do you mean? I didn't mean nothing. Except, I wonder, what do you want, Mr. Mentallo? Please leave. I didn't mean nothing. Come on, get out. September 19th, the fluid is almost gone. I use only the smallest amounts now, but the effect seems to be cumulative. But how can I work without a laboratory, without equipment, without money to buy what I need? There's so much undone, so much I don't understand. He drove them off today like they were scared. I saw them run from his show. Said he saw too much. He's all right, does his job. He keeps to himself. Why not? He's got a right. Does he? We all live and work together. He gives me the creeps. Maybe we give him the creeps. Did you ever see his eyes? He always wears those glasses and that mask. Now, Crane hustles for him. Crane, he thinks he's real. Real? What do you think, he's a ghost? Well, what he does is real. No tricks. - Coffee? - Sure, you bet. Two coffees. He sees not through your mind, but through things like paper and cloth. - He's got a good act, that's all. - No. Yeah, an act. What else could it be? A man that could really see through things, he wouldn't be here. No, he wouldn't. He'd be something big, powerful. He'd be something special. What would he be? He'd know secrets. Secrets he could use. A hold on people, that's what he would have. Something to make them listen to him. That what you think? I never think. I eat. Maybe he could help keep people from hurting each other. How? By telling everybody everything. No secrets, what's anybody got to fight about? Same things they've always fought about. Ideas, thoughts, differences. I'd stop them. If I had your power, I'd stop them. I'd make them do things my way or I'd hurt them all, if I had your trick. Trick? I thought you said it was real. Man was real, he wouldn't be here. Maybe this is all he could be. This, and nothing more. Nothing more than just a man. Fake. Cheap fake. Don't pay them no mind. Me, I know what you got is real. And you, what do you want to see? All the undressed women my poor eyes could stand. And you? What about you, Mr. Mentallo? First, money. And then, to be able to open my eyes. A wonderful performance. - Green, go get a doctor, quick. - Right. She's got a broken leg. Crane, get some wood for splints and some rope. She's also got two broken ribs. How do you know? Never mind. Take hold of her, it's gonna hurt. Take it easy. - These are all I could find. - They'll do. - The doctor's on his way. - Good. I also saw two broken ribs. Hang on to this while I immobilize this leg. You've got the power, the power to see inside. Shut up. - Here he comes now. Here he is. - Here comes the doctor. Good. He can take over. - You ain't no mind-reader. - No? But I know what you are. What am I? You're a healer. A healer of the sick. I watched you over there. You looked right through that girl and you knew what was wrong. A broken leg shows. But not broken ribs. I couldn't see nothing. Don't you understand? It means money, more money than you could make in 10 years working on the pier. You can heal them just by laying on your hands. You're out of your mind. But you can look right through a guy and see what's wrong with him, can't you? You said you wanted money, didn't you? We could set up a place in the city. Nothing fancy, no advertising. Just through word. When you're poor, the word gets around about a man that can heal just by looking. And we don't charge them a thing, not one penny. What about your money then, Mr. Crane? Donations, Mr. Mentallo. Everybody gives what he can. Just what he can. Here it is. It ain't much, but you said it don't matter. Any other rooms? Two, the bedroom and another storage room about half the size of this one. - Let's see them. - Right. The one in the back is the storage room. Wait. I'll tell you this once, and that's all. You will never enter these rooms. Never, under any circumstances. All right, all right. Whatever you say, Doc. He's there. It's just like I said, honest. I'm afraid, Mr. Crane. Now, you come along. Maybe he will, maybe he won't. - He's asleep. - It won't take a second. Healer, I brought you someone. Who are you? It's me, Crane. Don't you remember? Yes. Crane. I didn't mean to wake you. I brought Mrs. Mart. This is her. She says she's pained and sick to death. I thought you might be willing to tell her something. I have this pain in my back. It's tight, like a fist. And it grows. I think it's a cancer come to eat me. It's nothing. Nothing. Just tiredness and age, and nothing. And the pain? It'll be gone soon. I was afraid, but you are a good man. She's going. She's beyond my help. She said you were a good man. I guess she knows. She's a smart old woman. She'll pass the word. What? You're a healer. You can heal. I can't heal. I only look. And I tell what I see. Sure. I know what you mean, Doc. But that's enough. You wait and see. In one week's time, this place will be so packed you'll be turning them away. The effects of the compound are still unpredictable. At times, I can see through walls, through stone just as easily as I can see through the air. At other times, I can hardly penetrate the first layer of a man's skin. Sometimes I wonder why I keep on searching. I don't want power or fame or... I told you never to set foot in here. Yeah. You got quite a setup here. You got people waiting, lots of them. I'll be with them in a minute. You better come now. Here he is now. Here he is. All right, everybody, just take it easy. The healer will see everybody in a few minutes. You, miss. Hey, hey, you ain't in line. I'm his friend. I never saw you before. I've never been here before. Hey! Sit down. There's nothing wrong with you, young lady. You're perfectly healthy. Why are you here? To see you, Jim. - Diane? - Yes. How did you find me? I left the foundation, took up my practice again. Patients. First one, then others. They came to me for treatment knowing exactly what was wrong with them. Only one man could tell them that. It took me more than a month to find you, but I knew who I was looking for. I didn't want to see you again. But I'm here now. Yes. If what I'm seeing is really you. No, don't. It's worse without them. - The \"X\" effect? - Yes. Double. Sometimes triple. And sometimes, when I look up and I see all those people above me, pressing down upon me, the whole of humanity. And at night, while they sleep, I close my eyes and I can still see through my own eyelids. Oh, Lord. I'd give anything, anything to have dark. I've come to help, if I can. You can't go on like this. They're bound to discover you. You've got to go away somewhere where it's safe. No, no. You ain't going nowhere. I'm not letting you go. Not when things are just starting to pay off. Haven't you had enough out of their misery? Only my share. My share for keeping you out of the hands of the cops. I've got my power over you, Mr. Mentallo. Dr. James Xavier. I've known about you for some time. Ever since we hit this town. But I don't care. As long as I get my share. Get out of my sight. Get out of my way! You leave now and I'll turn you in, that's what I'll do. I'll see you hang, you murderer! No, you're not gonna get out of here. I'll tell you that. You're not gonna get out. You won't get away! He ain't no healer. He ain't. He looks inside you and he gives you the sickness. And you die! Killer! - Murderer! - Watch out! Murderer! Police, police! What do you see? This city, as if it were unborn, rising into the sky with fingers of metal, limbs without flesh, girders without stone, signs hanging without support, wires dipping and swaying without poles. A city unborn, its flesh dissolved in an acid of light. A city of the dead. Diane, I'm sorry, but I've got to get away. I must go somewhere I can work, where I can solve this thing, - learn to control it. - Where? Anywhere. Across the border, anywhere where I can work. - It'll take money. - I know. Would you come with me? Yes. You know, across the desert is a place where they have more money than I'll ever need. And I can get it. As a matter of fact, I'm the only man in the world, probably, who can get it and get away with it. You wait here. I'll be back in a moment. You've taken the drug again. I had to. The effect is wearing down. Are you all right? For what I have to do, yes. Come on. Are you nearly finished with this machine? This machine's nearly finished me. It's set to jackpot in two plays. Here. - I don't gamble. - This is not gambling. Well, what next? Over there. Eighteen. Can't win them all, darling. Hit me. Fine. Twenty. Pay the point. Twenty-one. You don't seem very worried. It's the house's money. Ain't mine, win or lose. Blackjack. Blackjack pays one-and-a-half times. Hit me. - He can't lose. - Again. Once more. Fine. Twenty. Twenty-one. This table is closed. All right, I'll play over at that table, then. Give me your bag. Jim, you've got enough, nearly $20,000. I could go on winning forever. They can't stop me from winning. I'll show you how to win. Now, wait a minute. - Deal. - Cut. I believe you. I stand. Don't draw. Don't draw. Why not? Because you've got 16 there. The next card's a face card. Jim, please, we'd better cash in and get out of here. All right. Pay me. Pardon me, sir, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Questions? You won a lot of money. I'd like to make sure you won it honestly. - What's it matter to you? - Jim. Look! Look! - No. - Look at his eyes. - What's the matter with him? - No! No! Look at his eyes. No! Something's real wrong with this one. Harry, you better go for the sheriff right now. Jim, they're calling the police. It's free. It's free. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Attention, James Xavier. This is the California Highway Patrol. Attention. You can't escape. I repeat, you can't escape. All forces have been alerted. Give yourself up. Stop and give yourself up. All roads are blocked. Let me sing hallelujah When he comes, hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah On that day - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! The children of God. Amen. For we are truly God's children. Hallelujah. He will guard and protect us against the ravages of sin. Amen. Now tell me, whom do we love? The Lord! Yes, we love the Lord. And what do we hate? Sin! Yes, we hate sin. We must destroy it. Hallelujah. And how shall we save our souls? Go forth. Then come forward and save your soul. Come forward and save your soul. Are you a sinner? Do you wish to be saved? Saved? No. I've come to tell you what I see. There are great darknesses, farther than time itself. And beyond the darkness, a light that glows and changes. And in the center of the universe, the eye that sees us all. No! You see sin and the Devil. But the Lord has told us what to do about it. Said Matthew in Chapter Five, \"If thine eye offends thee, \"pluck it out.\" Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out? Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out!

Here you are, Dan. Did you read it? - Just glanced through it. - Let's see it. Doesn't make sense. On the contrary, it's quite explicit. The symptoms are all wrong. In fact, the symptoms are totally non-existent. Symptoms? Remember that cowboy in ward 117? All his symptoms indicated he had acute hepatic infection. And it turned out to be mumps. Christ, this is practically a fucking death warrant. Suzy, wait 'til... Hmm. (door creaking) (Nancy screaming) Somebody, anybody, help! Oh, they killed Suzy! I don't know what's happened. They killed Suzy! (Nancy gasping) (killer groaning) (bones cracking) (dramatic music) Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep you here for a while. - Why? Some discrepancies in the tests. - But... - We'll have to keep you under observation for a few days. - Is it serious? - No. It's nothing. You can tell me the truth. Is it serious? Yeah. It might be. (dramatic music) (clock ticking) (spoons jingling) They say she's terribly sick. But she's so young and lovely. Young and lovely on the outside, maybe. Old and rotten on the inside, putrid and foul. - Oh, what a pity. - I wonder what ails her? - All her bones are decaying, and her organs are all rancid. And her blood is as malignant as slime. Would you just shut up! (dramatic music) Oh, well, here she is, up and around already. I've got to get out of here, Harry. This is unbearable, I just can take anymore. All right, fine. Now, just calm down. I want you to tell me something. How long have you been Dr. Jacobs' patient? - Three years, maybe four. - Mm-hmm. And when did she last give you a check-up? Two years ago. You know what the results were like? She said I was in great shape, except that I had low blood pressure. - Nothing else. - No. Are you sure? You're not holding anything back on us, now, are you? Of course not. Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll go take a look at Dr. Jacobs' files. (ominous music) Just be cool. Now, this is highly irregular. - What are we doing? - Shh. Gonna check on something. (door opening) - Well, what about that? - What? What is it? Don't you worry, baby. We'll have you out here in an hour. (sighs) Oh, thank God. You just go back to your ward and sit tight. Well, why are they keeping me here in the first place? Dr. Saxon acts as if I'm dying or something. Don't you worry about that. You let me handle it. Somebody's trying to play a con job on you, and I wonder who it is. You just go back to your room. (knocks softly) Dr. Saxon? (phone ringing) Hello? No, no, this is Harry. Yeah, okay, I'll be right up. What floor? Fine, be right there. (car horn honking) - Hello. - Yes, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Susan Jeremy. Is she a patient? She just came in to pick up some test results. I see. Let me try. Yes. Do we have a new admission of Susan Jeremy? I see. Thank you. Try the eighth floor nurse's station. I think they'll be able to help you there. (eerie music) Oh, who are you looking for? Miss Susan Jeremy. I've been waiting for two hours. Well, I don't know whether she can receive visitors or not. What? How come? Oh, Kitty? Now, he wants to see Miss Jeremy. Are you a relative? What the hell do you mean? Better check with Dr. Saxon. What's going on here? Well, you see, she's under observation. Observation? Well, what does that mean? It means she's under observation. Well, that explains everything. Where? Okay. Around this corner, 8-B. Make it fast. - Jack! Oh! - Hey. - Oh, God. - What is all this? - They won't let me go. - Why? What's going on? They said something's wrong. - Wrong? What do you mean? - I don't know. They've been treating me as if I've got leprosy or something, except they won't tell me anything. Well, how do you feel? - I feel perfectly fine. - Look, Sue, really? I'm all right, honest. Except, I'm really worried about Eva. Tom left her alone in his apartment. She's sitting there, waiting for us. Let's get outta here. - Can you? - I don't see who's gonna stop me. Okay. Get dressed, let's go. I don't even know where my clothes are. I'll just go just as I am. You have to sign out or something? Why bother? I never signed in. (tense music) - Going somewhere? - Yes, I'm checking out. Take Miss Jeremy back to her ward, please. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'm not going back to that zoo! - You'll have a private room. - I'm - Just as soon as one is available. I don't want a private room, I want out! Out! - Come on, Miss Jeremy. Get your hands off me. Harry said I could leave. Harry did? On whose authority? Take her back to her room. Come on, you gotta go. Now, calm down. Jack! For Christ's sake! Don't just stand there! Do something! - Come on. - Jack! Wait a minute! Is this necessary? - Necessary? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Why? She's very ill. Ill? Can't you tell me anything more? Please, we're engaged. There's a bench outside of my office. Why don't you go have a seat. I'll fill you in later. (ominous music) [Male Announcer] Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? I'm the only gentleman in the hallway. Are you calling me? Of course I'm still here. I was told I could wait, so I waited. Yes. Yeah, what? Room 9117 No? Wait, I can't hear you. No, service to... right, right, I'll find him. (suspenseful music) (both scream) Jumping Christ! You scared the shit out of me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (grunts) I'm sorry. (ominous music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chanting) (spoons jingling) (clacking) - Dr. Jacobs? Dr. Jacobs? - That's not Dr. Jacobs. Why, no, it's a fine young man. Well, where is Dr. Jacobs? (suspenseful music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chattering) [Man] Over here. Come closer. Is she your mistress? I beg your pardon? [Man] Are you sleeping together? Does she let you hold her in your arms? Can you touch her wherever you like? In all her secret places? What is this, some sick joke or something? (suspenseful music) (saw buzzing) Please, help me! Please, don't! (screaming) (killer growling) (squelching) (clock ticking) (eerie music) (footsteps approaching) (Susan shrieking) Help me! Oh! Help me! Can somebody help me? (men groaning) (equipment rattling) (Susan screaming) (tense music) (Susan panting) (door clattering) (Susan gasping) (shrieking) It's all right! It's all right! It's all right. - Jack! It's Jack! - Jack left. - No, he didn't! No, he's here. (sobbing) Somebody cut off his head! Susan, you're being irrational! - No! No! - Stop it! No! - No! No! - Susan, stop. Cut it out! Come on, Kitty, get her outta here. Come on! Come on! - No! No! - Okay, show us where he is. - No! No! I don't wanna see him! - Come on, Susan. All right. Okay now, Susan, where is it? It's there in that box! Go on. (tense music) Go ahead, open it. So you have an unknown admirer, Susan. It was Jack's head! It was only a nightmare, Susan. The hell it was! And did they see it? They weren't here. Oh, they weren't here? It was Jack's head! No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't! I want you to stop this nonsense. Dr. Saxon, Harry got my medical chart from Dr. Jacobs' file. - He what? He said there was no reason to keep me in this goddamn hospital. He opened Dr. Jacobs' files? He said somebody's trying to con me. What'd he do with your chart? I don't know, he took it with him. All right. There are photostats of all of the doctors' files in the archives upstairs. I'll check on it in the morning. Why not right now? Go ahead, check it now! Here, Susan, take this. Thatta girl. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (heavy breathing) (sinister whispering) (lighter clatters) (elevator bell dings) (Susan screams) Give me a cigarette, huh? What are you doing sneaking around this place? I bet you're waiting for your boyfriend, huh? I'm trying to escape out of here. Hey, what's your big rush? You know, stick around. We'll have a ball. How about a little kiss? (screaming) (tense music) (Hal growls) (Susan breathes loudly) (sinister music) (Saxon gasps) (Saxon groaning) (Susan gasps) (eerie choir chanting) (blood gurgling) (gasping) (whimpering) Help! Help! Help! Help! (Susan crying) No! No! - Get her sedatives! Relax! What's the matter with you? No! No! (screaming) They're going to put her in the straps! That oughtta make her shut up! Stop! Stop it! (all struggling) Get your hands off of me. Damn it, off! What are you doing? You stupid, stupid nurse! I'm trying to tell you I just saw a murder! - This is like the last time. - What are you doing to me? You have no right to do this! (screaming) - It's for your own good. - You stupid nurse! Listen to me! You stupid nurse! Somebody killed him, he's dead! Who do you think you are? This whole hospital is nuts! Don't you people understand somebody was just murdered? Let me out of this! Please, help! - Get her hip. Help me! Help! Don't you understand somebody was just murdered? What is wrong with this hospital? - Now what? - It's another seizure. I'm not having a seizure! She said she saw someone kill Dr. Saxon with an ax. He didn't try, he killed him! Some sort of hallucinatory fit, just like the last time. It looks like a typical attack of delirium tremens. Saxon was complaining of a lack of symptoms. This is clearly symptomatic enough. What is wrong with everybody in this hospital? (Susan groaning) (Beam groans) Why don't you listen to me?

RUN. >> AND THANK YOU FOR FLYING STAR TOURS. ♪♪ >> MOVIES HAVE BEEN MAKING US LAUGH AND CRY, GASP AND SCREAM FOR OVER 100 YEARS. AND SINCE THE EARLIEST DAYS OF CINEMA, ADULT FILMS HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE MOTION PICTURE LANDSCAPE, MAKING US GASP FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS. AS FAR BACK AS THE 1880's, FILMMAKERS SAW THE GOLDMINE POTENTIAL OF EROTIC FILM-- LOOPS, STAG FILMS, PEEP SHOW BOOTHS. FOR THE NEXT 90 YEARS, SOCIETY WATCHED SEX IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THEN IN THE 1970's, EVERYTHING CHANGED. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A MORE SOCIALLY PERMISSIVE ATMOSPHERE, DIRECTORS BEGAN TELLING STORIES SURROUNDING THE HARDCORE SEX. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, FULL-LENGTH MOVIES WITH EXPLICIT SEX WERE BEING SHOWN IN THEATERS FOR A MASS AUDIENCE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GERARD DAMIANO'S FILM, \"DEEP THROAT.\" THIS MOVIE OPENED THE DOOR FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY ADULT FEATURE THAT CAME AFTER. WHILE THE EXAGGERATED CLOSE-UPS, CAMPY PERFORMANCES, AND FIREWORKS GOING OFF DURING ORGASMS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE COMICAL TO A MODERN AUDIENCE, IN 1972, AUDIENCES HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WHETHER DISCUSSING ADULT OR MAINSTREAM, \"DEEP THROAT\" REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST >> YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT MORE OUT OF SEX THAN JUST A LOT OF LITTLE TINGLES? >> YES, I WANNA HEAR BELLS AND BOMBS-- >> YES, WE JUST WENT THROUGH THAT, MISS LOVELACE. LET'S NOT DO THAT PART AGAIN. >> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDER A CERTAIN AGE UNDERSTAND JUST HOW EDGY AND HOW RADICAL IT WAS TO PUT ACTUAL SEX IN A BIG MOVIE THEATER. >> \"DEEP THROAT,\" IN PARTICULAR, OPEN A LOT OF DOORS. IT MADE IT-- SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND THEN THAT HELPED IN MAKING >> \"DEEP THROAT\" AND... \"THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES\" PLAYED THE DOUBLE BILL FOR, >> WHEN \"DEEP THROAT\" CAME OUT IN NEW YORK THEATERS, LINES AROUND THE BLOCK-- JACKIE O. >> JACKIE KENNEDY WENT TO SEE-- >> DEEP THROAT IS THIS GIRL SHE'S-- SHE'S TIRED OF-- OF SEX. SHE THINKS THAT IT SHOULD BE MORE THAN JUST LITTLE TINGLES. >> IT MAKES ME FEEL SORT OF TINGLY ALL OVER, AND THEN-- >> AND THEN WHAT? >> NOTHING. I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE MORE TO SEX THAN A LOT OF LITTLE TINGLES. THERE SHOULD BE BELLS RINGING, SEAMS BURSTING, BOMBS GOING OFF-- SOMETHING. >> DO YOU WANNA GET OFF, OR DO YOU WANNA WRECK A CITY? >> SHE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE CAN'T HAVE AN ORGASM, BECAUSE SHE HAS ALL THIS SEX, AND NOTHING-- I MEAN IT'S NICE, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. SO, UM, SHE GOES TO SEE A SEX THERAPIST, MR. HARRY REIMS, WHO, UM, EXAMINES HER AND DISCOVERS THAT HER CLITORIS IS ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK OF HER THROAT. >> WELL, THERE IT IS. YOU LITTLE BUGGER! THERE IT IS! >> WHAT? >> WELL, YOUR CLITORIS, IT'S DEEP DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR THROAT. >> (SOBBING) >> NOW, NOW, MISS LOVELACE, LISTEN, HAVING A CLITORIS DEEP DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR THROAT IS BETTER THAN HAVING NO CLITORIS AT ALL. >> THERE'S A THEME SONG-- I FORGOT. UM, THERE'S A THEME SONG WHEN SHE DISCOVERS THIS-- THIS, UH, SKILL. >> ♪ DEEP THROAT ♪ ♪ DEEPER THAN DEEP YOUR THROAT ♪ ♪ DEEP THROAT ♪ ♪ ROW ROW YOUR BOAT ♪ >> SHE FINALLY HAS AN ORGASM. THERE'S A MONTAGE OF FIREWORKS AND BELLS RINGING AND A ROCKET SHIP GOING UP WHILE IT'S FLASHING BETWEEN HER FACE COMING AND... SO FUNNY. SO HE HIRES HER AS A NURSE, AND SHE GOES OUT ON CALL AND FUCKS ALL THESE GUYS. >> TELL ME, MR. MOORE, HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? >> AND, EVENTUALLY, SHE FINDS THE PERFECT PENIS FOR HER THROAT. AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER MONTAGE. IN MOST '70s PORNO, EVERYONE HAS A LOT OF HAIR, BUT IN \"DEEP THROAT,\" LINDA IS COMPLETELY CLEAN-SHAVEN. I WONDERED IF MAYBE SHE STARTED THAT TREND PERHAPS? OR MADE IT POPULAR AT LEAST? I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE SAW IT, >> NIXON, ALONG WITH KEATING, AND THAT ADMINISTRATION WAS OUT TO STOP THE NEGATIVE PRESS OF WATERGATE AND, UH, VIETNAM. >> I THINK REVISITING THIS STORY AND REVISITING, YOU KNOW, THE TACTICS THAT CAME INTO PLAY THAT, UH, THEY HAD A PROBLEM MORALLY WITH SUBJECT MATTER, AS IN \"DEEP THROAT,\" THE FILM, UM, IS IMPORTANT. >> AND THE EASIEST TARGET WAS THE ADULT FILM INDUSTRY. NIXON RIGGED THE COURTROOM AND RIGGED THE JUDGE AND GOT HIS, UH, CONVICTIONS AGAINST THE CAST MEMBERS OF \"DEEP THROAT.\" >> I DEFINITELY THINK SHE'S-- SHE'S BETTER AT, UM, DEEP-THROATING THICKER COCKS THAN I AM, BUT I DEFINITELY DROOL A LOT MORE THAN SHE DOES. >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS THE RAVISHMENT OF A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN ABDUCTED. >> I ANSWERED AN AD IN THE \"SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\" THAT SAID \"NOW CASTING FOR A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE.\" SO I WALKED UP THE STAIRS, AND I SAT IN THEIR OFFICE, AND HERE'S THESE TWO BROTHERS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY CHARMING, FABULOUS NOT THE LEAST BIT OF A QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THEY WERE TOTALLY HONEST GUYS. (SCREAMING) THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THE STORY OF \"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR,\" WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY COOL, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME OF DRUGS, SEX, AND ROCK-N-ROLL. IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING WENT. BEFORE I LEFT, I SAID, \"IF YOU DO WANT ME TO DO THIS, BY THE WAY, I WANT THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THIS PERCENTAGE OF WHATEVER FOR SO MANY YEARS.\" AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, \"DON'T CALL US, WE'LL CALL YOU.\" SO ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I'M SITTING AT MY HOUSE, AND THEY CALLED AND SAID, \"WE WANNA DO IT.\" SO THEY CAME OVER FOR ME TO SIGN THE CONTRACT, AND THAT WAS, UH, THAT WAS THE END OF THAT. >> ALTHOUGH, AT FIRST, HER REACTIONS MAY LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHE IS BEING TORTURED, QUITE THE CONTRARY IS TRUE, FOR NO HARM WILL COME TO THOSE BEING RAVISHED. IN THE MORNING, SHE WILL BE SET FREE, UNAWARE OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT SHE HAS BEEN LOVED AS NEVER BEFORE. >> THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE MOVIE WAS-- AND I SAID TO THEM, \"I'M AN ACTRESS, AND I SAY NOT ONE WORD.\" HE SAID, \"OH, NO, THAT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT,\" WHICH IT IS. BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO CONVEY YOUR FEELINGS, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, THROUGH YOUR EYES AND YOUR ACTIONS. AND I SAID, \"I DON'T REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE WILD AND SEXY, AND IT'S GONNA BE SCARY, PROBABLY, FOR ME AT CERTAIN TIMES, BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.\" JOHNNIE KEYES, HE WAS THE BLACK GUY WITH THE SHARK TEETH AROUND HIS NECK AND, UM, VERY ETHNIC LOOKING. AND WHEN WE STARTED TO HAVE SEX, IT WAS THE KIND OF THING WHERE I WAS, LIKE, TOTALLY FREAKED OUT, I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA >> I FUCKED HER FOR A LONG TIME. I FUCKED HER FOR 43 MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING. NOBODY DOES THAT. THAT WAS A MARATHON FUCK. WHERE IT TURNED FROM TERROR TO PLEASURE, AND I REALLY BELIEVE YOU CAN SEE THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A TIME THAT I FELT MYSELF SLIP ON TO THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. >> UH, MARILYN, SHE PASSED OUT, SHE FAINTED. AND I-- IN MY MIND, I SAID, \"SHIT, I'M GOING TO JAIL. I DONE KILLED THIS WHITE WOMAN WITH MY DICK.\" >> WELL, THE TRAPEZES WERE A BIT MUCH. IT'S A GOOD THING I WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF STANDING AROUND, LITERALLY, ON TOP OF PEOPLE, AND THERE WAS TRAPEZES AND WHATNOT. YOU HAD TO BE A GYMNAST, DEFINITELY. THE WAY THAT THE STORY OF-- WHEN \"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR\" AND \"IVORY SOAP BOX\" CAME OUT, I TOLD THE MITCHELL BROTHERS THAT, \"OH, BY THE WAY, I DID THIS COMMERCIAL FOR PROCTER & GAMBLE, UH, IVORY SOAP BOX.\" AND THEY'RE SAYING, \"WHAT?\" WE WALKED DOWN THE SOAP AISLES, WE LOOK, AND THERE IS MY MUG ON ALL THESE BOXES, STARING DOWN AT US, AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE VERY SAME WEEK THAT \"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR\" OPENED IN THE THEATERS. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT I CREATED PORNO CHIC, BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS PART OF IT. AND THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE LIKE JOHNNY CARSON WERE WAITING IN LINE TO SEE \"DEEP THROAT.\" IT WAS COUPLES, AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE GOING TO SEE ADULT FILMS AND GETTING >> YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M DEAD, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SEND ME UP TO HEAVEN OR DOWN TO HELL. >> I REALLY HONESTLY THOUGHT NOBODY I KNEW-- MUCH LESS ANYBODY I WAS RELATED TO-- WOULD EVER KNOW ABOUT IT. I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD. >> \"THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES\" WAS DEFINITELY AN ART MOVIE, AND I'M STILL NOT REALLY 100% SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE STORY WAS. BUT I STILL THINK IT WORKED. >> CAN YOU HELP ME? I-- I SEEMED TO HAVE LOST MY WAY. >> I'LL HELP YOU ALL I CAN, BUT YOU'RE NOT LOST. >> THEN WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE HERE. >> JERRY DAMIANO WAS THE SWEETEST GUY I EVER MET. HE LOOKED BACK OVER AT ME, AND HE SAYS, \"CAN YOU COOK?\" I SAID, \"YEAH.\" HE SAID, \"OKAY, YOU WANNA COOK ON THE FILM?\" I SAID, \"SURE.\" HE SAID, \"I GOT SOMEBODY COMING IN TO READ THE PART OF THE DEVIL IN THIS FILM I'M DOING. WOULD YOU MIND READING WITH HIM?\" AND I SAID, \"SURE, I'D BE GLAD TO.\" I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. DOESN'T THAT COUNT FOR ANYTHING? AND HE LOOKS OVER AT ME, HE SAID, \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY MISS JONES?\" AND I SAID, \"AND COOK?\" HOW ABOUT LUST? >> LUST? >> YES, LUST. IT IS ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, ISN'T IT? >> HE OFFERED ME $100 A DAY TO DO MISS JONES. AND I SAID, \"THAT SOUNDS GOOD.\" SO I WAS MAKING 125 A DAY, INSTEAD OF JUST 100. >> GEORGINA WAS AMAZING. HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, AND THE WAY THAT SHE FUCKED WAS SO PASSIONATE. LIKE, SHE-- SHE BROUGHT ENERGY TO ALL OF THE SCENES, AND IT REALLY, REALLY SHOWED. >> FOR THAT DAY, IT WAS A BIG BUDGET FILM. I THINK THEY WERE SPENDING SOMETHING LIKE $25,000. IT DIDN'T PUT MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE, BUT IT CERTAINLY DID OPEN UP AN INTERESTING CAN OF WORMS FOR MY LIFE. THAT SUICIDE SCENE-- EVERY ACTOR AND ACTRESS IN THE WORLD, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, WANTS TO PLAY A DEATH SCENE. >> A SUICIDE AT THE BEGINNING OF A PORN MOVIE REALLY SETS THE TONE. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY BRAVE TO START A MOVIE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SEX WITH DEATH. >> AH, HERMAN, HERMAN, THAT BEAUTIFUL, SWEET, AFFECTIONATE BOA, WHO COULD TURN AND LOOK AS FIERCE AS YOU WANTED HIM TO. WHAT AN ACTOR. IT WASN'T PLANNED FOR HIM TO BE IN THE FILM. AND I'M TALKING TO THE SNAKE ON THE BED, AND JERRY WALKS BY AND SKIDS TO A HALT AND SAID, \"YOU'RE A SNAKE WRANGLER.\" HE SAID, \"WOULD YOU DO A SCENE WITH IT?\" MARKS SAYS, \"$100 A DAY, SAME AS I GET.\" SO HERMAN WAS IN THE FILM. THE ANAL SCENE, WHICH EVERYONE, OF COURSE, ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT-- I DON'T KNOW-- IT'S-- IT'S A HUGE FANTASY IN EVERYONE'S MIND, I THINK, TO-- TO GIVE IT A TRY. AND WHEN IT GETS ALL BIG AND FAT AND HARD AND SLIPPERY, AND YOU COULD STICK IT IN MY ASS. GETTING FUCKED IN THE ASS IS JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF-- YOU GET USED TO IT. >> ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THE SEX SCENES WAS GEORGINA'S DIRTY TALK. >> CAN YOU FEEL HIS PRICK? CAN HE FEEL YOU? CAN YOU FEEL HIM? CAN YOU FEEL YOUR COCKS TOGETHER? CAN YOU, RUBBING AGAINST MY... >> IT SO ADDED TO THE SEX SCENE. THE DIRTY-- THE DIRTY TALK WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST THINGS OF THE MOVIE FOR ME. >> WHEN JERRY CALLED ME ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE DID THE FILM AND SAID, \"I WANT YOU TO GO TO TORONTO FOR THIS GRAND OPENING--\" IT WAS LAVISH, IT WAS ELEGANT, IT WAS COVERED BY A MILLION CAMERAS ALL OVER THE ROOM, AND SPLASHED ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND... I SAID, \"WELL, SO MUCH FOR ANIM-- ANONYMITY NOW. I GUESS I-- I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS WHAT >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> MISTY BEETHOVEN. >> IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME? >> NO, IT'S NOT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD SOUND MORE IMPORTANT. >> WHAT WAS IT BEFORE? I WAS CAST IN \"MISTY BEETHOVEN\" AND I FLEW TO NEW YORK, AND I MET HIM, AND HE TALKED TO ME AND EVERYTHING AND TOLD ME TO GO BACK HOME AND TO GET EVERY BIT OF CLOTHING, EVERY PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD EVER BEEN TAKEN OF ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND BRING IT ALL BACK TO NEW YORK. >> AS HYMAN MANDEL ONCE SAID, \"NEVER LET THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DOING IT WRONG STOP YOU FROM DOING IT RIGHT.\" >> WHO WAS HYMAN MANDEL? >> I DON'T KNOW. I READ THAT ON THE MEN'S ROOM WALL AT THE NEW YORK >> IT'S A TAKE ON GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S \"PYGMALION\" OR MODERN-DAY \"MY FAIR LADY\" OR EVEN \"SHE'S ALL THAT,\" IF YOU'RE IN THE BUT IT'S TAKING THIS WOMAN, WHO IS, LIKE, A DIME-STORE HOOKER, BASICALLY, GIVING HAND JOBS IN MOVIE THEATERS. >> EXCUSE ME, MY GUM WAS IN FRONT OF YOU. >> HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT WAS YOURS? >> FIVE SEATS IN. FIVE'S MY LUCKY NUMBER. YOU AMERICAN? >> MOST OF THE TIME. >> FIVE BUCKS FOR A HAND JOB. I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE IN TEN MINUTES. >> TEN MINUTES? >> MM-HMM. TEN MINUTES. I HAVE TO MEET NAPOLEON. >> NAPOLEON? >> NAPOLEON. HI. YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME. >> JAMIE GILLIS WAS A SEXOLOGIST, AND HE WAS GOING TO TRAIN ME TO BECOME THE >> HE TAKES HER ON AS A PROJECT WHERE HE FEELS HE CAN TURN THIS LOWLY STREET GIRL INTO A >> MY DEAR, YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE NADIR OF PASSION, THE MOST UNEXCITING THING GOD HAS EVER CREATED, A SEXUAL CIVIL SERVICE WORKER. NOBODY NEEDS TO READ MY LAST BOOK MORE OR DESERVES TO BE IN MY NEXT BOOK LESS THAN YOU. >> IT'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE YOU'RE WATCHING THIS VERY INSECURE CONSTANCE MONEY GO FROM THIS VERY UNATTRACTIVE WIG AND MAKEUP TO THE END, WHERE SHE'S BASICALLY TAKING ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MEN IN TOWN AND PUTTING A STRAP ON AND FUCKING HIM WITH IT. >> I WENT UP TO SEE A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF RADLEY METZGER, WHO, UH, HIS NOM DE PORN BECAME HENRY PARIS. AND, UM, UH, INSTEAD OF BEING, UH, ON THE FILM, HE'S A BIT OF A SVENGALI, AND I WOUND UP BEING IN THE FILM. YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LET HIM MAKE THAT PERILOUS JOURNEY ALONE? IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT BEHAVIOR AND PROTOCOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE, UH, ON AN ADULT SET, SO IT WAS REALLY BREAKING INTO SOMETHING THAT BROKE ALL THE RULES. >> ♪ WISH I HAD HER BESIDE ME ♪ >> IT'S FUNNY-- I WASN'T EVEN AWARE-- IT WAS-- I WAS WATCHING THE FILM, BUT I WAS ROOTING FOR BOTH OF THEM TO BE TOGETHER UNTIL THE ACT-- END MOMENT WHERE SHE'S GIVING HIM A BLOW JOB, AND HE'S DEGRADING HER AS IF SHE'S NOT IN THE ROOM, UH, PRETENDING THAT SHE'S NOT THERE, AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS MOMENT WHERE THEY-- THEY COME TOGETHER. IT'S JUST-- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> YOU KNOW WHY MOST PEOPLE HAVE SEXUAL PROBLEMS? THEY TALK TOO GODDAMN MUCH! >> JAMIE IS A VERY SWEET PERSON ON ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A VERY DISTURBED INDIVIDUAL. JAMIE HAD HIS DEMONS. >> YOU INSTANTLY JUST ARE SO ENGAGED BY HIM. IN FACT, WHEN I STARTED WATCHING THE-- THE OPENING IN \"MISTY BEETHOVEN,\" I WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT JAMIE GILLIS WAS A PORN PERFORMER. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO NOT HAVE ANY SEX IN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE HE WAS SO GOOD. YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, \"HOW COULD THIS GUY BE A PORN ACTOR?\" >> WORKING FOR RADLEY METZGER WAS, UM-- I DON'T REALLY KNOW. I-- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REALLY SAY IT-- IT COMES BACK TO THAT THING, \"IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE...\" >> OKAY, LET'S GET YOU UNDRESSED. NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T DO IT YOURSELF. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW, FOR ONE THING. >> HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T THINK I COULD ACT, AND THAT'S WHY HE PUT ME THROUGH EVERYTHING. THAT WAS HIS JUSTIFICATION. >> I THINK MEN STINK. >> WELL, THEY THINK YOU STINK. IN FACT, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST PERFECTLY BALANCED EQUATIONS IN NATURE. >> I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT MOVIE WAS MADE MORE WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT THAN MONEY. HE REALLY DID MAKE A MASTERPIECE. I'VE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE QUOTE LINES FROM IT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. >> IT HAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG STORY WITH BEAUTIFUL IMAGERY. >> AND, ALSO, I MEAN, LOOKING AT IT ALL THESE YEARS LATER, IT WAS ALSO-- I MEAN I LOOKED PRETTY GOOD, TOO. I THINK IT WAS ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WAS MORE REALITY THAN FANTASY. >> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON WITHIN THAT MOVIE THAT REALLY SAYS, \"THIS IS AN ARTISTIC >> EXCUSE ME. UH, PARDON ME. DO YOU MIND IF I BLOW YOUR WAITER? >> NOT AT ALL. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO MINE. >> BARBARA BROADCAST WAS A MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS A SEX WORKER WHO WROTE A BOOK. IT'S TAKING PLACE AT A RESTAURANT, AND PEOPLE ARE GIVING BLOW JOBS AS IF IT'S NO BIG DEAL. NOBODY'S BATTING AN EYE, NOBODY'S LOOKING AT IT PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX ON TABLES. AND IT WAS WHAT I FEEL A TRUE ADULT SHOULD-- FILM SHOULD BE, WHERE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO JUDGMENT ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM. >> YES, WE'LL HAVE YOUR RESERVATION IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME. >> THERE'S A LOT OF JOKES IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST.\" ONE OF THEM IS WHEN THE MAITRE 'D, UM, HE RECEIVES A BLOW JOB EVERY TIME SOMEBODY DROPS A PLATE OR MESSES UP. AND IT'S JUST SO CAVALIER IN THAT HE JUST UNBUTTONS HIS PANTS, AND THEY GET DOWN ON THEIR KNEES. >> WELL, BOBBY ASTER I REMEMBER VERY WELL, BECAUSE HE'S THE VERY FIRST PERSON THAT I EVER WORKED >> ANNETTE HAVEN'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND BE A SEXUAL WOMAN. >> MY BROTHER'S KIND OF SHY, AND, WELL, HE'S A BIG, BIG FAN OF YOURS. WELL, WOULD YOU MIND GIVING HIM AN AUTOGRAPH AND A LITTLE HEAD? >> ANNETTE, UM, WAS JUST, UH, JUST ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESSLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I HAD EVER SEEN, LET ALONE I THINK IT WAS THE-- THE FIRST RED BUSH THAT I HAD EVER SEEN. SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK AND A GREAT BUSINESSWOMAN, AND, UH, NUTTIER THAN A FRUITCAKE AS WELL. >> IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST,\" METZGER'S USING THESE VERY WIDE SHOTS WHERE YOU'RE SEEING SEXUAL ACTIVITY HAPPENING WHILE THERE IS DIALOGUE HAPPENING BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS. THERE ALSO WAS ANOTHER JOKE IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST\" THAT I LOVED WHERE I BELIEVE IT WAS THEY ORDERED UP A NUMBER 17, WHICH, BASICALLY, WAS A MAN CAME ON A SALAD. >> HE DOES A WONDERFUL CAFE AU LAIT. >> IT'S CINEMATICALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE LOCATIONS, I MEAN, SHOOTING AT, UH, A RESTAURANT. I MEAN, THE KITCHEN SCENE WITH C.J. LAING WITH ALL THE STEAM AND THE POTS AND THE PANS AND THE THIS AND THE THAT AND... >> THEY TOOK A SCENE FROM \"MISTY BEETHOVEN,\" I UNDERSTAND, AS A FILLER FOR THE GIGANTIC CLIM-- CLIMAX OF THE FILM. >> SO WE HAVE THIS LITTLE PET WORKING FOR US, AND TO SET HER STRAIGHT, WE LET CURLY AT HER, TO ACT OUT ONE OF HIS FANTASIES. JIMMY WASN'T VERY NICE TO ME WHEN HE FIRST MET ME. THE MAKEUP LADY, SHE KEPT PUTTING MORE HAIRPIECES IN MY HAIR, MORE AND MORE HAIRPIECES. SHE SAID, \"WELL, I DON'T WANT HER BRAINS TO SPILL AND JAMIE SAID, \"WELL, IF IT'S GONNA BE REALISTIC-- IF THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT, THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT. STOP PUTTING THOSE HAIRPIECES IN HER HAIR.\" I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. >> JAMIE WOULD CALL ME WHENEVER HE WAS IN KIND OF ONE BIND OR ANOTHER. HE SAYS, \"MITCH, YOU'VE GOTTA COME HERE RIGHT AWAY. YOU'VE GOTTA COME RIGHT-- RIGHT AWAY,\" AND I HEAR THIS, LIKE, WATER SOUND, LIKE, THIS FLUSHING SOUND. HE'S LIKE, \"HURRY, HURRY.\" SO I THREW SOMETHING ON, AND I JUMPED IN A CAB. I GET THERE, AND JAMIE WAS FUCKING C.J. FROM BEHIND, BUT HAD HER HEAD IMMERSED IN THE TOILET BOWL, AND SHE HAD A NECKLACE ON, AND THE CATCH GOT CAUGHT, AND SO HE HAD TO KEEP FLUSHING THE TOILET IN ORDER FOR HER TO GET AIR. AND I GOT THE CATCH FROM UNDERNEATH HER NECK, AND, UH, SHE COMES UP FOR AIR AND SAYS, >> I'LL GIVE YOU $10 IF YOU LET ME LOOK AT YOUR TITS. >> MR. GREENFIELD! >> PLEASE, PLEASE, I JUST WANNA LOOK AT YOUR PRETTY LITTLE TITS. >> YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL GOOD GIRLS. >> THE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME-- I'D WORKED FOR HIM QUITE A FEW TIMES-- I HELPED CAST SOME PEOPLE IN THAT FILM. I ALSO, UM, FOUND A WAY TO GET ACCESS TO BROOKLYN COLLEGE. AND WE KINDA KNEW WHEN THE FACILITIES WERE OPEN. WE-- IT WAS LIKE \"DO WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN.\" WE JUST LUCKED OUT. WE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING. >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER ON SET WHEN BAMBI WOODS WAS ON SET. MAYBE I MET HER ONE TIME. SHE WAS, FOR THAT TIME, INCREDIBLY HOT-LOOKING. >> DEBBIE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? >> RAISE THE MONEY FAST. >> WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE, DEBBIE? >> IN TWO WEEKS. >> BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RAISE THE FARE. >> THE WORST THING ABOUT \"DEBBIE DOES DALLAS\" IS R. BOLLA'S THE ONLY GUY THAT GETS TO FUCK HER. YOU WANNA FUCK THAT GIRL. I MEAN, IT'S A COMPLETE TEASE. IT'S A-- IT'S A COCK-TEASING FILM, AND IT WORKED ON THAT LEVEL. >> SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT... >> OH! >> (WHISTLE BLOWS) >> THE DALLAS COWBOYS STARTED THE WHOLE CHEERLEADER CRAZE, AND IT REALLY WENT VIRAL. IF YOU COULD USE THAT WORD BACK THEN. AND SOMEBODY WAS SMART ENOUGH TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA IT WOULD BLOW UP LIKE IT DID. >> NO, MOM. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU. >> OH, DARLING, I'M SO GLAD. KIRDY STEVENS. WE MET-- WE MET AT A RESTAURANT IN, UM, WEST L.A., AND HE TOLD ME IT WAS ABOUT INCEST, AND I SAID, \"NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.\" >> I LOVED \"TABOO\" AS A MOVIE. IN FACT, THE ENDING WAS SO DISTURBING AND BOTHERSOME TO ME THAT SHE DIDN'T END UP WITH HER SON, IT MADE ME QUESTION MY OWN >> HE PERSISTED, AND THEN, UM, AGAIN, I-- I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THIS AS MY HIGHER SELF JUMPED IN AND SAID, \"DO IT.\" BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DO IT. YOU-- IF YOU DO IT, YOU CAN BRING CONSCIOUSNESS AND QUALITY TO IT, SO DO IT. >> WE ARE CENSORING OURSELVES FROM DOING THINGS THAT ARE AS FREE AND AS OPEN AS THEY WERE 35 YEARS AGO. I MEAN THEY WERE MORE FREE 35 YEARS AGO. >> I HATED THE SCRIPT THE FIRST TIME I READ IT. IT WAS-- IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO, UM-- TO READ ABOUT INCEST IN SUCH A SORT OF FLIPPANT, UM, MANNER. BUT IT WAS SO WRONG. >> LOOK, MA, I DON'T THINK ANY LESS OF EITHER ONE OF US. IT HAPPENED, AND I GOTTA TELL YA, I WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. >> DON'T-- DON'T... NO, PAUL, DON'T. THE WORLD HAS A DIRTY WORD FOR THIS. >> THERE'S THESE-- THESE MOMENTS THAT KIND OF MAKE YOU SAY, \"WHOA!\" THESE JARRING MOMENTS, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN KAY PARKER IS IN THE KITCHEN, AND HER BREAST IS HANGING OUT OF HER SHIRT, AND SHE'S STANDING THERE WITH HER SON, AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERE'S NO COVERING UP, AND IT-- IT'S JUST, AGAIN, SEX IS OUT THERE. >> I MEAN I'M NOT EXACTLY OVER-THE-HILL, YOU KNOW. >> YOU'RE TELLING ME. >> YOU SEE IT A LOT WITH KAY PARKER'S FRIEND IN THE MOVIE, WHO IS HAVING ORGIES AND-- AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH-- SHE THINKS IT'S HOT IMAGINING THAT HER SON WOULD BE HAVING SEX WITH HER. SHE REFERENCES THAT KAY PARKER IS, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN KIND OF ASSAULTED BY HER BOSS. AND SHE'S ON THE PHONE WITH HER FRIEND, AND THE FRIEND SAYS... >> WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE? IS JERRY RAPING YOU? >> CUT THAT OUT, YOU SON-OF- A-BITCH! >> WHAT'S HE DOING? DOES HE HAVE HIS COCK OUT? >> BUT IT-- IT-- IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE FIND SEXUALLY AROUSING, EVEN IF IT IS NEC-- EVEN IF IT IS FORBIDDEN. >> WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THE-- THE SCENE, THE SEDUCTION SCENE WITH MIKE RANGER IN \"TABOO,\" I-- I GET GOOSEFLESH-- I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW, AS I-- AS I GET READY TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I DO REFER TO IT AS A VERY, UM, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE. >> SHE'S JUST LEFT THIS ORGY PARTY THAT SHE FELT EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN, AND SHE JUST FINDS IT WITHIN HERSELF THAT SHE MUST HAVE SEX, AND HE'S SAFE FOR HER. HE IS SAFE. >> (GROANING) >> I LOST MYSELF IN THAT SCENE. I WAS NOT THERE. I SURRENDERED, IF YOU WILL, TO THE PART, AND THE PART, OR THE ROLE, THE MOTHER, JUST TOOK ME, UM, ON THIS TRIP. >> IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, YES, THIS IS THE NATURAL THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND I. THAT'S-- >> (INTERVIEWER) I'M APPALLED. >> THERE'S NOTHING WRONGER >> WHAT'LL IT BE, GENTS? >> OH, THE MASTER WILL HAVE A BEER, ANYTHING IMPORTED. >> BOTTLE OF BUFFALO PISS, PLEASE. >> THE AMERO BROTHERS MADE A BIG BUDGET COMEDY. WE JUST HAD A LOT OF FUN. I SWEAR, THE BURNING OF ATLANTA SCENE OR WHATEVER WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER >> NOW, REMEMBER, PAY NO ATTENTION TO ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU, JUST DO WHAT I SAY. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE SCENE I'D LIKE TO GET DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE WE ARE SHOOTING THE BOMBING OF ATLANTA THIS AFTERNOON. >> (ALL SCREAMING) >> IT WAS FUNNY AND QUIRKY. IT WAS-- IT WAS VERY HORNY, IT HAD SO MANY SEX SCENES. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. >> I DID IT IN A BOAT ONCE, AND I HAD TO DO ALL THE ROWING. >> R. BOLLA AND I ARE IN WYOMING, WHERE WE MEET THE CANE SISTERS. I DECIDE TO TAKE THEM TO NEW YORK WITH US, AND-- AND SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE, \"WHAT, YOU GOT AN AIRPLANE?\" >> ANYWAY, I'M TO BE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES, AND I'VE GOT THIS TERRIFIC GOWN RIGGED UP. >> A GOWN? ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE TRANSYLVANIANS? >> SUSIE MANDELL WAS THE-- MY FAVORITE OF THE TWO CHARACTERS. >> CANDY, WHAT'S A FILM LOOP? >> YOU'VE GOT ME. >> THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 46 GIRLS AND A MONKEY. >> IT WAS REALLY A TRIBUTE TO THE, UH, MGM MOVIES, ONLY WITH HARDCORE SEX. >> FUCK. >> THE RAPE SCENE WHERE THE YANKEES CAME IN AND, LIKE, BANGED ALL THE CHICKS. >> I WANT A CUM SHOT, OR NONE OF YOU FAGGOTS GET PAID! >> \"BLONDE AMBITION\" WAS PLAYING IN NEW YORK-- THE R-RATED VERSION AT ONE THEATER, AND THE X-RATED VERSION AT >> IT'S SANDY, AM I RIGHT? OH, BUT THERE IS AN AMAZING RESEMBLANCE. BUT NOW THAT I LOOK AT YOU, >> WELL, IS MY SISTER HERE OR NOT? >> \"NEON NIGHTS\" HAD A VERY VERONICA HART PLAYED A MADAME, AND I WAS KIND OF HER BOY-TOY, >> I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT, BABY. YOU'RE MY PRIVATE FUCKING >> THE FILM WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUCKED UP. UM, THE DAUGHTER IS LISTENING TO HER MOM AND HER MOM'S BOYFRIEND AND THEN SHE STARTS MASTURBATING WITH A HAIRBRUSH. AND THEN SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM, AND HE COMES IN, AND HE'S TELLING HER TO SHUSH AND TURN AROUND, AND HE'S GRABBING ON HER AND TOUCHING HER. >> NO. >> TURN AROUND, COME ON. TURN AROUND, BABY. THAT'S A GIRL. THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. >> WHEN JAKE TEAGUE MAKES LYSA THATCHER ELEVATE, THEY DID IT VERY WELL, LIKE, HE WAS PUTTING HIS ARMS UNDERNEATH HER BUTT AND OVER HER BOOBS AND OVER HER VAGINA AND, LIKE, DOING THE WHOLE CREEPY THING, AND THEN I LOVE HOW HE GOT IN HER MIND. HE WAS HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHILE HE WAS INSIDE OF HER MIND, AND SHE WAS FEELING EVERYTHING THAT HIM AND THE OTHER WOMAN WERE DOING. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. >> SO VERONICA, BACK HOME, IS TAKING A SHOWER, AND A LA HITCHCOCK IN \"PSYCHO,\" UH, I ENTER-- BUT I HAD SOME FLOWERS-- AND I PULL BACK THE CURTAIN, AND SHE SCREAMS. >> (SCREAMING) ♪♪ (STRINGS SHRIEKING) >> GOTCHA! OH, MAN, WERE YOU EVER GOIN'! >> NO! >> PEEING IN YOUR PANTS, YOU WERE SO SCARED. >> YOU FUCK! >> SHE'S ALL PISSED OFF AT THAT, AND THEN WE GO OFF IN THE BEDROOM AND MAKE REALLY FRANTIC AND HARD, HARD SEX. >> I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL AT KEEPING THE PLOT TOGETHER AND MAKING IT AN INTERESTING MOVIE THAT IS, NOT ONLY RISKY AND DIFFERENT AND VERY INTERESTING WITH THE MAGICIAN AND HER HITCH-HIKING AND BEING IN LOVE WITH HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND, >> I WANNA GIVE IT A TRY. I DON'T WANNA LOOK BACK WITH REGRETS. YOU KNOW, IF ONLY I'D GONE TO NEW YORK, I COULD'VE BEEN >> THE PLOT OF \"ROOMMATES\" IS SHE HAPPENS TO BE A HOOKER, AND SHE DECIDES TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS. AND HER APARTMENT'S TOO BIG FOR HER, SO SHE CONSIGNS TWO ROOMMATES TO COME >> WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT-- >> ONE WAS, UH, A BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS MODEL, WHO, UNFORTUNATELY, SEEMED TO HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM AND GET IN AND I PLAYED A COLLEGE STUDENT WHO, ACTUALLY, I THINK, RAN AWAY FROM COLLEGE. I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY COLLEGE PROFESSOR, AND IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME AT ALL. >> MY CHARACTER HAD SOME BAD PEOPLE IN HER LIFE, AND, UH, STUFF HAPPENS BECAUSE I RUN RAMPANT, AND I KIND OF LEARN MY LESSON. WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE IN QUEENS. WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? >> THE FAMOUS RAPE SCENE FROM \"ROOMMATES.\" SO MUCH OF IT WAS INFERRED. THE BACKS OF THE ACTORS WERE TO THE CAMERA. I WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR. >> RUB SOME ON HER FACE, SAL, RUB IT IN. MAKE HER EAT IT. >> AGAIN, YOU HEAR THE SOUNDS, YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE WORST POSSIBLE THING IS HAPPENING TO ME. JAMIE GILLIS COMES BURSTING IN, STARTS KNOCKING THE GUYS ASIDE, AND THEN JAMIE STARTS DOING JAMIE GILLIS. >> DID THEY HURT YOU? >> NO. >> LET ME SEE IF THEY HURT YOU. THEY STUCK THE BOTTLE-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH THE BOTTLE WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY SHOVED IT IN? >> HE'S NOT THERE TO HELP ME, HE'S THERE TO JERK OFF ON ME, YOU KNOW? SICK, TWISTED JAMIE GILLIS. >> HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN DEGRADING ANYBODY, YOU KNOW? CHUCK'S IDEA OF A GREAT TIME WAS TO-- TO HAVE FUN. >> (LAUGHING) COME ON, YOU GUYS ARE ANIMALS. TAKE A BREAK ALREADY. IT DIDN'T FIT INTO ANY CATEGORY. SO CHUCK REALLY WENT OUT ON A LIMB TO MAKE THIS. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES WHERE EVERYBODY WASN'T RUNNING AROUND, GOING \"FUCK ME, FUCK ME, FUCK ME.\" >> IN THE END OF THE 1970s, THEATRICAL PORN FILMS BEGIN TO STRUGGLE. OBSCENITY PROSECUTIONS ROSE, ZONING LAWS HAD FORCED ADULT THEATERS INTO THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THE PORN CHIC THAT FUELED TICKET SALES DIED OUT. BUT THERE WAS A NEW FRONTIER OPENING FOR ADULT MOVIE PRODUCERS-- THE VCR WAS ABOUT TO REDEFINE THE PORN INDUSTRY >> WHEN DID PEOPLE START TO BUY VHS's? WHEN WAS THAT STARTING TO BE THE NORM VERSUS, UH, GOING TO THE THEATER? >> IN THE MID-'70s, THE MACHINES CAME OUT, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE GREATEST INVENTION AND THEY HAD TO HAVE ONE-- YOU HAD TO GO OUT. BUT, LIKE YOU SAID, THEY WERE EXPENSIVE. THEY WERE $1,000 A MACHINE. AND THE MOVIES THEMSELVES WERE $95. THEY WOULD HAVE PARTIES, THOUGH. THEY WOULD GO IN AND CHIP IN >> THERE WAS MORE WORK THAN-- THAN GIRLS IN THE BUSINESS. LIKE, THERE WERE, LIKE, 12 OF US REALLY IN THE BUSINESS, IT SEEMED, AND I THINK WE ALL I MEAN, IT WAS JUST-- THE-- THE PRODUCERS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH GIRLS. >> SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE SHOOTING-- WHAT WAS A DAY ONSET LIKE BACK THEN? >> UM, LET'S SEE, THERE WAS USUALLY A SCRIPT, LIKE, A 20-PAGE SCRIPT, WHICH ALWAYS IRRITATED ME, 'CAUSE I WAS NOT GOOD AT MEMORIZING THINGS. IT WAS ALWAYS SHOT AT, LIKE, A REALLY NICE HOUSE, THE LOCATION-- NOT ALWAYS, BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS, YOU KNOW, SHOT IN REALLY NICE HOUSES UP IN PORN VALLEY SOMEWHERE. THEY ALWAYS HAD CATERING, HAIR, AND MAKEUP. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE-- IN A WEIRD WAY, IT WAS KINDA LIKE BEING ON A REAL MOVIE SET, ONLY WE WERE NAKED HAVING SEX. >> YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE PLAYBACK AT-- ON THE SET. IT WAS LIKE A WHOLE NEW WORLD. BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT THE BEST. BUT EVERYBODY WANTED TO DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP, IT WAS QUICK, IT WAS PAINLESS. >> SO, AS A PERFORMER, WHAT... DID THE CONSUMERS SORT OF EXPECT FROM YOU? LIKE, WERE YOU GUYS SHOOTING A LOT OF CRAZY SEX ACTS? >> NUDITY. NO. >> OR DID THEY WANT YOU TO BE A GOOD ACTRESS? DID THEY CARE? DID THEY JUST WANNA SEE YOUR-- >> I THINK, IN 1984, THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH A FILM IN THEIR HOUSE OF A NAKED GIRL SUCKING A GUY'S DICK. LIKE, THERE WAS DEFINITELY NO CRAZY SEX ACTS LIKE THERE ARE-- I MEAN, IT WAS KINDA LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE TYPICAL THREE POSITIONS, HEAD, HIM EATING ME OUT, BUT IT WASN'T CRAZY SEX. I REALLY THINK, BACK IN '84, PEOPLE WERE JUST SO HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX >> GOOD EVENING, MUTANTS AND MUTETTES, AND WELCOME TO >> THE STORYLINE IS THERE'S BEEN THING AND, IN THE WAKE OF THAT, STILL STAND THE TOUCH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, AND THE REST OF THEM CAN'T. >> TRUST ME, FOLKS, I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, AND I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GET IT. NEED IS MY FIX, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. >> AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, HAVE SEX ARE FORCED TO STAGE THESE LIVE SEX SHOWS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX LIKE THAT. IT'S, LIKE, WEIRD AND EXPERIMENTAL, BUT THEN IT'S GOT THIS VERY OBVIOUS METAPHOR ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY AND ITS PLACE IN THE WORLD. >> LEAVING SO SOON, FRIEND? FEELING A LITTLE QUEASY? >> LIVE THEATER, ON THE OTHER HAND, AND THE HISTORY OF LIVE THEATER, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF WHERE \"CAFE FLESH'S\" REFERENCES PROBABLY CAME FROM. >> \"CAFE FLESH\" STANDS THE TEST OF TIME BECAUSE IT'S A PORNO ABOUT PORNO. IT, IT VERY MUCH IS WHAT IT IS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO WONDERFULLY HONEST ABOUT IT. BUT THEN IT'S GOT ALL OF THE OTHER LAYERS, SO IT REMAINS INTERESTING. I MEAN, YOU WATCH IT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES, YOU'RE STILL GONNA >> DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU FUCKING YOUR BEST FRIEND'S WIFE? >> (CHUCKLING) YOU'RE IN >> \"SCOUNDRELS\" WAS THE FIRST FILM TO WIN A BEST PICTURE AWARD AND HOWARD SAID TO ME, CECIL HOWARD, \"YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRACK ONE JOKE IN THIS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE-- NO MUGGING TO THE CAMERA. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A HAM.\" >> RON JEREMY SCARED ME AT THAT TIME, UM... IT WAS, IT WAS REALLY ODD BECAUSE, BEFORE I HAD MET RON JEREMY, I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, UM, BUT HIS HEADSHOT TO ME LOOKED LIKE >> HOWARD WAS A TOUGH GUY. CECIL HOWARD WAS TOUGH. HE WANTED THINGS HIS WAY. BUT I RESPECT THAT. >> I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH CECIL HOWARD, AND HE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS, AND I WORKED FOR HIM >> EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIE IS VERY DARK LIT AND VERY DARK IN GENERAL. THE DRAMA OF THE MOVIE, I THINK, >> AH, I'M GONNA CHANGE. >> THAT'LL BE THE DAY. >> IT'S A FASCINATING PSYCHODRAMA. THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I'M IN CLOWN WHITE TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE. >> I'VE BEEN GOOD. I'VE BEEN REAL GOOD. FUCK IT, NOBODY TELLS THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME. >> EVERYBODY'S FUCKING EVERYBODY IN THIS MOVIE, BUT IT'S NOT A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY THING, YOU KNOW. THE DOCTOR IS CHEATING ON HIS, UM, HIS WIFE WITH HIS SECRETARY. AND, YOU KNOW, HIS SECRETARY'S CHEATING ON HIM WITH HIS BEST FRIEND WHO, I BELIEVE, HIS WIFE IS ALSO SLEEPING WITH. (SIGHING) AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER WHO FEELS INVISIBLE. >> MY PERFECT PARENTS. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. WHAT DO I LIKE? I LIKE MAKING LOVE. >> SO SHE'S TAKING IT OUT BY BECOMING A WHORE AND HAVING ALL THE SEX IN THE WORLD THAT SHE CAN. >> SHE'S THE GIRL AT THE CANDY STORE ON THE CORNER. THAT'S WHY I GET TO SEE HER EVERY DAY, AND THEN FINALLY, I JUST TELL HER TO HOP IN. SHE GETS IN MY CAR, AND WE'RE GONNA ESCAPE AND RUN AWAY. >> MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME I SHOULD MARRY A DOCTOR. (HORN HONKING) (SCREAMING) >> WE CRASH MY CAR AND DIE. WHICH IS CERTAINLY A STATEMENT AGAINST INFIDELITY, YOU KNOW? >> EVERYBODY HAS A DARK SIDE, AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO HIDE NO MATTER HOW PRETTY YOUR SURROUNDINGS ARE. AND THIS MOVIE REALLY DIGS INTO EVERYBODY'S SEXUALLY DEVIANT DARK SIDE. >> NO ONE FILMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. CECIL HOWARD, CHUCK VINCENT, RADLEY METZGER, HENRI PACHARD, ANTHONY SPINELLI ON THE WEST COAST, THESE GUYS MADE FILMS WHICH HAD SEX IN IT. >> BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> ELIZABETH. >> THAT'S A NICE NAME. >> SPINELLI, HIS NAME WAS SAM, HE WAS THE BACKBONE HE WAS MORE THAN, UH, A TALENTED DIRECTOR. HE WAS MAKING THE BEST MOVIES. AND HE BECAME A FRIEND AND A MENTOR. >> ANTHONY SPINELLI... >> WHO IS... >> HE WAS MY-- HE'S A DIRECTOR. HE'S MY DAD. IT WAS A GREAT TEAM. HE WOULD USUALLY SAY, \"I HAVE AN IDEA.\" AND I'D GO, AND I'D WRITE THE ROUGH DRAFT, AND WE, UH, SHOWED IT TO HIM, AND WE-- GREAT COLLABORATION, >> THE PLOT OF \"NOTHING TO HIDE\" REALLY REMINDED ME OF \"OF MICE AND MEN.\" AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FOR A PORN MOVIE. HOW TO BE A MAN. AND \"LOVE'S FOR SUCKERS,\" HE'S TEACHING ME. AND I FALL IN LOVE, AND I WANNA MARRY. >> HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO LOVE SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> I THINK THAT THERE IS PARTS OF THIS MOVIE THAT YOU CAN JERK-OFF TO. >> SLOW AND DEEP. >> AS LONG AS YOU'RE INTO JOHN LESLIE. ONE OF THE SCENES IN THERE HAS SOMETHING FOR MOST PEOPLE TO JERK OFF TO. >> OH, JACK! >> I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN JERK OFF TO THE RICHARD PACHECO SCENE. >> NONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HAD COME BY FIT WHAT SAM WANTED TO COME OUT OF THAT CHARACTER. >> AH! WHY DON'T YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING?! >> SHE WAS PERFECT. >> THE SEX SCENE BETWEEN RICHARD AND CHELSEA WAS MY FAVORITE. IT WAS SO REAL. >> I SORT OF GOT MY-- SOME SPITTLE ON MY FINGER AND PLAYED WITH HER NIPPLE AND... \"NO, NO, NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LENNY WOULD NEVER DO THAT!\" >> SEE? >> OH, IS THAT A RUBBER? >> HOW'D YOU KNOW? >> I SAW ONE IN MY BROTHER'S DRAWER. >> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT IN A PORN MOVIE BEFORE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY STOP THE SEX TO PUT ON A CONDOM, AND THEY TALK ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM AND HOW SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, AND IT JUST-- IT WAS SO, SO REAL. I LOVED IT. >> THERE'S A GREAT AWKWARDNESS AND PLAYFULNESS ABOUT WINNING THIS, ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM 'CAUSE IT'S PLAYED, PLAYED REALISTICALLY. SPINELLI PLAYED THE OWNER OF A HOT DOG STAND. >> YOU DON'T FOOL ME. YOU DON'T WANNA STOP BEING A MOTHER AND A FATHER, RIGHT? >> HE AND JOHN HAVE A LONG SCENE WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, \"YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS IS WHAT IT IS.\" YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE KID. WHEN AVN DID THEIR FIRST AWARDS, THEY GAVE ME BEST ACTOR FOR \"IRRESISTIBLE\", AND THEY ALSO GAVE ME BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR \"NOTHING TO HIDE.\" THAT PROBABLY WAS THE >> FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, I'VE BEEN WRITING STORIES, NOT FOR PUBLICATION BUT FOR A VERY CURIOUS MAN, A PRIVATE CLITEROTICA. >> JANINE AND I BECAME BEST FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE 18 AND 19 YEARS OLD. AND I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US REALLY KNEW WHAT TO BE TOTALLY PREPARED FOR. I THINK SHE'D DONE SOME... SHE'D BEEN A \"PENTHOUSE\" PET SO SHE'D DONE SOME \"PENTHOUSE\" VIDEOS, BUT NOT EXACTLY THE HARDCORE WE WERE ABOUT READY TO GET INVOLVED IN. >> WORKING WITH ANDREW BLAKE, HE'S, UM... HE'S VERY UNDERSTATED, YOU KNOW, QUIET GUY, BUT HIS WHEELS ARE ALWAYS >> ANDREW BLAKE IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ARTIST. I MEAN, HE'S QUIRKY. HE'S INTERESTING. SOMEWHAT INTROVERTED. BIT OF A RECLUSE, UH, EXCEPT FOR WHEN HE'S FILMING, AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHEN IT ALL >> I HIRED THIS GUY TO MAKE THESE-- HE MADE, LIKE, >> AND BOY, AT THE BEGINNING, THERE'S SOME MIGHTY HEFTY ONES. THEY WERE QUITE BIG. >> AND WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE SET, HE WAS BLOODY, AND HE HAD CUT HIMSELF, AND HE NEEDED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AND HE DROPPED OFF THE DILDOS, AND, YOU KNOW, I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. (CHUCKLING) >> AND, OF COURSE, BY THE TIME WE WERE DONE, WE WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. >> I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ADULT INDUSTRY. AT THAT TIME OF MAKING \"HIDDEN OBSESSIONS,\" I HAD NEVER HEARD OF VIVID. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BIG-BUDGET CONTRACT GIRLS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. >> I MEAN, BASICALLY, I'M ONE TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR. THAT WAS THE WRONG FIRST SCENE TO EVER DO. >> I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING, UH, STILL SHOOTING FILM. WHEN I'M 80, AND I'M STILL SHOOTING SOME 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AND I WANNA KEEL OVER, AND MY BOLEX GOES INTO HER PUSSY. THAT'S WHAT I ENVISION FOR >> WELL, I GUESS THESE ARE FOR IF YOU'RE LONELY AT NIGHT AND, UH, NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. >> YEAH. >> I TOOK THE IDEA OF \"JUSTINE\" FROM A FRENCH FILM BY, UM, A DIRECTOR NAMED LOUIS MALLE. IT'S ABOUT A FATHER WHO FALLS FOR HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. >> I SAID, I'VE SEEN IT. AND HE SAID, \"WHAT'D YOU THINK?\" AND I SAID, \"I HATED IT.\" HE SAID, \"YOU HATED IT, WHY?\" I SAID, \"BECAUSE OF THE MORALITY THAT THIS MAN WOULD DESTROY HIS SON AND HIS WIFE FOR THE SAKE OF >> IT WAS AN EVENT OF MY... SORT OF... HAVING A SON WHO'S IN SOME WAYS MORE GROWN-UP THAN ME. HE'S TELLING ME, YOU KNOW, >> WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. >> I'M THINKING ABOUT MY FATHER. >> YOUR FATHER? >> IN \"DAMAGE\", UH, JEREMY IRONS IS THE FATHER. HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. HE DIDN'T CARE. >> BUT IN OUR MOVIE, THE FATHER WOULD NOT DESTROY HIS SON. HE WOULD GIVE UP THE GIRL BECAUSE HIS SON IS HIS SON. >> MMM. WOULD YOU LIKE A TASTE? >> I LIKE OUR VERSION BETTER. >> ROXANNE BLAZE HAD A SERIES OF ENDLESS ORGASMS FROM A WATER HOSE I WAS SPRAYING HER WITH. AND THAT WAS VERY REAL, IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. >> SHE'S ONE OF HIS GIRLS, HE WOULD LOOK AND-- AND SAY, \"WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?\" WHY'D YOU COME BACK, HMM? >> BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE. BECAUSE YOU'RE DANGEROUS FOR ME. >> WE REALLY FELT WHAT WE WERE DOING-- YOU KNOW, WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY PORN. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE IT THE BEST PORN WE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE IT. >> \"JUSTINE\" DOES QUALIFY AS ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES MADE, UH, UH, BOTH IN THE HISTORY OF PORN, BUT IN MY PERSONAL HISTORY WORKING. IT WOULD BE IN MY TOP TEN >> MY CRIME WAS TO SHARE THESE VISIONS WITH YOU. THE TRUTH. AND FOR THIS, I HAVE BEEN >> \"LATEX\" WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE BUT THEN THERE WAS ABOUT 12 MONTHS OF POST MAKING ALL OF THIS STUFF, SO THAT MIGHT'VE THIS IS A WHOLE MOVIE FULL OF COMPUTER-GENERATED EFFECTS. THIS WAS SO FAR BEFORE ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR PORNO, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON A MICHAEL NINN FEATURE KNEW THEY WERE IN FOR A RIDE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WALK IN AND BE OUT OF THERE IN AN HOUR. UH, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A COUPLE OF HOURS JUST TO GET YOUR MAKEUP ON. HE SAYS THAT YOU CLAIMED TO BE ABLE TO \"SEE INSIDE OF PEOPLE.\" DID YOU SAY THAT? >> YES. >> I'D CALL THAT E.S.P., WOULDN'T YOU? >> I WOULD CALL IT SEEING >> JON DOUGH REALLY TOOK HOLD OF THAT ROLE AND CREATED THAT ROLE ALMOST ON HIS OWN. UM, MICHAEL NINN MADE IT INTO VISUALLY POWERFUL MOVIE AND TECHNICALLY FAR SUPERIOR THAN MOST EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE THAT. >> YOU'RE ASKING ME TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MYSELF. >> HE WAS SO DEEPLY DEDICATED TO WHAT WAS GOING IN THERE, MORE THAN I EVER SAW HIM IN ANY MOVIE. >> THERE WAS ONE SET, THE KITCHEN SET WITH ZACK AND SUNSET THOMAS. THAT'S THE ONLY SET WE SHOT ON. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SHOT AGAINST GREEN SCREEN, WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD TO BE MANUFACTURED >> I'M IN THE KITCHEN, YOU KNOW, LATEX GLOVES ON. AND THERE'S THESE BIG, WHITE AND I WAS IN THE DRESSING ROOM. I WAS JUST ALL UPSET BECAUSE I WAS SO USED WEARING THESE LITTLE SKIMPY UNDERWEAR. I SAID, \"MIKE, I CANNOT WEAR THESE GRANNY UNDERWEAR.\" >> MICHAEL NINN SEEMS TO DEAL MORE WITH, UM, BROAD SYMBOLISM, LIKE, SYMBOLIC STORIES. THEY WERE HUGE STORIES THAT TALKED ABOUT BASICALLY GOOD AND EVIL. THERE'S ALWAYS THE INNOCENCE THAT GETS CORRUPTED. THERE'S THE, THE SOCIETY THAT CHURNS UP THE INNOCENTS IN ITS GEARS, IT'S-- IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC AND BROAD IN ITS SCOPE, AND I THINK ANDREW BLAKE WAS MORE ABOUT INSTANCES. >> HOME VIDEO BECAME SUCH A POPULAR FORMAT FOR PORN THAT, BY THE MID-90'S, ADULT THEATERS WERE ESSENTIALLY A THING OF THE PAST. PRODUCERS TRADED NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO FOR SUNNY L.A., AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BECAME THE UNDISPUTED CAPITAL OF THE ADULT BUSINESS. VHS AND THE INDUSTRY SEEMED LIKE A MARRIAGE THAT WOULD LAST FOREVER. BUT PROGRESS NEVER STANDS STILL. AND A POWERFUL NEW FORMAT WAS ABOUT TO BRING NEW OPTIONS AND >> WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY PURSE? >> TO FIND YOUR BADGE. YOUR FIREMAN I.D. >> YOU'RE THE KIND OF GIRL WHO TAKES OUT PERSONAL ADS. \"OH, HOT-BLOODED BLONDE >> IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER \"BACKDRAFT,\" THAT BIG FIREMAN AND WHEN IT CAME TO \"FLASHPOINT,\" WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS WE HAD KIND OF STARTED TO ELEVATE OUR ADULT MOVIES INTO WHAT WE THOUGHT SEX OUT OF THEM, BECOME KIND OF LIKE THAT \"B\" MOVIE VIBE. >> I JUST WISH I HAD IT HAD A STORYLINE. AND IT HAD REAL ACTING. >> FOR ITS TIME, IT WAS A HUGE MOVIE, AND, UH, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, I JUST HAPPENED TO MEET A BIG PYROTECHNICS GUY WHO WORKED IN THE MAINSTREAM. >> THEY ACTUALLY WORKED ON \"BACKDRAFT.\" >> WHEN WORKING WITH FIRE, OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS A HUGE AMOUNT OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ESPECIALLY WITH THE MAINSTREAM GUY DOING IT ALL, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SAFETY MEETINGS ALL THE TIME. >> AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A FIREFIGHTER. SO THEY HAD ME CARRYING DUMMIES UPSTAIRS. >> I THINK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE STARTED THINKING THEY WERE GONNA PASS OUT RUNNING UP AND DOWN STAIRS WITH ALL THE GEAR ON. >> STEVENS, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? >> SHH! >> IF THE CAPTAIN CATCHES YOU, YOUR ASS IS HISTORY. >> I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW INCREDIBLY REAL THIS WAS GOING TO BE. WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SEX BEHIND FIRE, YOU DON'T REALLY REALIZE THE FEAR THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE FEELING. >> WE REALLY ONLY HAD ONE HUGE FIRE DAY, AND HE HAD A HUGE CREW IN THERE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND REALLY HAD A GRASP OF WHAT THE ISSUES WERE WHEN IT CAME TO SAFETY AND ANY, UH-- AND KEEPING THE ACTORS OUT OF DANGER. >> I REALLY THINK THAT WE-- WE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND SOMETHING >> TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DIDN'T EXACTLY INHERIT MY FATHER'S SIN... >> IT WAS NOT A HIGH-BUDGET MOVIE. OVER FIVE DAYS FOR 70 GRAND. SO 2-1/2 DAYS, $35,000... IT'S NOTHING FOR FILM. >> TO ME, IT WAS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER ONE-- YOU KNOW, THE FILMS WERE HERE AND THERE, JUST FEW AND FAR >> DIDN'T YOU APPLY AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS OR SOMETHING? >> YEAH, I GOT ACCEPTED, TOO, BUT I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE YET. >> THE ACTORS THAT CAME ON REALLY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, I GOT GOOD PEOPLE WITH ACTING CHOPS. SHANNA McCULLOUGH WHO, YOU KNOW, LATER WON AN AWARD FOR IT FOR BEST ACTRESS. >> THIS WAS A FILM NOIR AND IT WAS A DETECTIVE STORY AND HE WANTED ME TO STAR IN IT. IT'S A STORY OF TWO DETECTIVES AND THIS WOMAN WHO'S A FEMME FATALE KILLER. AND SHE'S, YOU KNOW, SEDUCING MEN AND THEN KILLING THEM. AND SHE'S BEEN STALKING MY PARTNER. APPARENTLY, HIS FATHER DEALT WITH THIS ALSO FEMME FATALE IN HIS CAREER AS A POLICEMAN. AND HE THINKS IT'S THE SAME WOMAN AND SHE'S STILL AROUND AFTER 50 YEARS. AND I SAID, \"NO, IT MUST BE HER DAUGHTER.\" >> THE LOOK OF \"LOOKER\" IS VERY GRITTY AND NOIR INSPIRED AND THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. I WANTED TO DO A MOVIE THAT COULD'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE 30s. >> HE WAS A REAL SLAVE DRIVER. HE LITERALLY WOULD WORK A 24-HOUR DAY IF THAT WAS WHAT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST AND HE WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE. >> WHEN WE SHOT THAT MOVIE, WE KNEW WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL. >> WE PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT AND NIC PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT, AND WE DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT MUCH ANYMORE SO IT REALLY FELT GOOD THAT IT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT WE REALLY WANTED IT TO BE. >> EARLY ON IN THE SHOW, SHANNA WON FOR BEST ACTRESS. AND WE WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE, \"COULD THIS BE?\" AND THEN JUST THE FLOODGATES JUST OPENED UP AND WE WON BEST FILM DIRECTOR FOR ME, BEST FILM, ART DIRECTION, SCRIPT, EDITING. I MEAN, TRIFECTA, SWEEP. SO IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER >> DOGS LICK. MEN FUCKING EAT PUSSY. EAT MY PUSSY. >> \"SEVEN DEADLY SINS\" WAS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE FOR THE VIGNETTE STYLE OF SHOOTING. I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYTHING DISTINCTLY, UH, REPRESENTED BY THE SIN ITSELF. >> WHERE AM I? >> YOU STUPID BITCH. >> THE BASIC STORY IS A CRISIS OF THIS WOMAN WHO'S IN LOVE WITH THE REAL JANINE. AND SHE'S BEEN TOLD THAT SHE ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKS LIKE JANINE, BUT OF COURSE, WE HAVE A REALLY DOWDY VERSION OF HER. SO THE CHALLENGE WAS HOW DO WE >> IT WAS A STRETCH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH... I WAS JUST KIND OF... IT'S HARD NOT TO JUST EMBRACE HER. SO, UH, TO TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION AND BE LIKE, \"YEAH, IT'S ME AND IT'S ME,\" >> YOU KNOW, THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE HAD TO HIDE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOOT AND BE SOMEBODY, AND YOU CAN'T SHOW YOUR FACE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO IT WASN'T EASY. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. >> YOUR A WHINY, DRIED-UP OLD MAID. >> SHUT UP! >> THAT NOBODY WANTS. >> SHUT UP. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF FOOD. THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF-- (GIGGLING) IT'S A PERFECT SCENE IF YOU'RE A FOOD FETISH KIND OF GUY. >> WE HAD TO BUILD SUPPORTS FOR THESE-- I THINK THEY WERE TEN-FEET TALL-- AND WE DID AN ARC AROUND THAT. AND THEN SET THAT IN A STAGE THAT, AT THE TIME, I THINK WAS BLACK. SO WE COULD, YOU KNOW-- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY GOT A TURNTABLE FOR THEM TO HAVE SEX ON SO THAT COULD REVOLVE, SO THE IMAGE BEHIND IN ALL THE MIRRORS WAS REVOLVING AT THE SAME TIME. IT HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF A SURREAL DEPARTMENT STORE >> HEY, WATCH THE TEETH, SWEETIE. >> SORRY, FORCE OF HABIT. >> \"DARK ANGELS\" CAME OUT-- SCOTT TAYLOR, THE OWNER OF NEW SENSATIONS. HE GOES, \"I'VE ALWAYS REALLY KIND OF LIKED HORROR MOVIES AND STUFF AND VAMPIRE-TYPE STUFF.\" AND I SAID, \"WELL, WE CAN DO >> YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL TONIGHT? >> IT DEPENDS, YOU A COP? >> YOU SEE A BADGE, SWEETHEART? >> WHEN I CONCEIVED THE WHOLE STORY AND WAS WRITING THE SCRIPT AND EVERYTHING, MIKE HORNER WAS ALREADY CAST IN MY HEAD. >> WE HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME PREPPING AND SETTING UP FOR THE BLEEDING SCENE THAN WE DID ON THE ENTIRE SEX SCENE, BECAUSE IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS FOR THEM TO THEY HAD TO CLEAN THE CAR ONE TIME FROM ALL THIS BLOOD-- ALL OVER THE WINDOWS. IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR >> I WAS JUST GETTING TO THAT. >> WE DIDN'T GET STARTED DOING THAT SCENE UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. AND WE WENT TILL LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING, 5:00 IN THE MORNING. WE GOT OUT OF THERE JUST IN TIME FOR THE SUNRISE. >> WHEN I APPROACHED SYDNEE TO DO THE MOVIE, I SAID, \"ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, WE'RE GONNA DO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FULL-BODY CAST OF YOU, PROSTHETICS.\" 'CAUSE THAT'S HER IN THE MONSTER SUIT AT THE END. AND, YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING CONTACTS AND ALL THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THIS? >> AND I'M LOOKING AROUND THE WAREHOUSE AND THINKING, \"MAN, YOU KNOW, I'M WORKING IN THIS WAREHOUSE AND, YOU KNOW, I'M A NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE PALLETS THAT LAY HERE ALL OVER, BROKEN.\" \"AH, I'LL NEVER FALL ON THAT.\" IN THE DUMPSTER, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? PALLET, RIGHT, RIGHT? A PALLET AND BROKEN GLASS. >> JEWEL DE'NYLE WAS THE CONTRACT GIRL, AND SHE ACTUALLY QUIT, UH, FIVE DAYS BEFORE WE FINISHED SHOOTING. SHE STORMED OFF THE SET. IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SHOT THE END ALREADY. IT BROKE A LOT OF RULES WHEN IT CAME OUT. IT UPSET SOME PEOPLE, IT EXCITED A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT MADE A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW? IT WAS-- IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GREAT EXPERIENCES THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DUPLICATE, EVEN WITH BIGGER BUDGETS, BIGGER CREWS, NEWER EQUIPMENT, EVERYTHING. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MAGIC THAT WENT INTO >> YOU TRIED TO GET MY ATTENTION. >> YES. >> WELL, YOU DID. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR DVD. ANYTHING ELSE IMPRESS YOU >> I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE, UH, THE SCRIPT WAS THE BEST SCRIPT THAT I THOUGHT I HAD EVER COME UP WITH IN TERMS OF INTERESTING IDEAS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WRITE IT. (SHRIEKING) >> TO BE DIRECTED BY JOHN, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS MOVIE, WAS SO SPECIAL FOR ME I WAS A BIG FAN OF ALL THE \"BUTTMAN\" SERIES. I WAS A BIG FAN OF JOHN, SO IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A DREAM. >> I HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH MY CINEMATOGRAPHER WHO SAID, \"WELL, WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO GIRLS?\" AND I SAID, \"OH. THEY COULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.\" THAT'S MORE THAN JUST THE GIRL IN THE BACK ROOM TRYING TO SEDUCE ROCCO. >> MY ENGLISH AT THAT TIME WAS HORRIBLE, LIKE, BARELY ANY ENGLISH. ROCCO SPEAKS FRENCH VERY WELL SO HE WOULD TRANSLATE SOME OF THE THINGS, BUT THE FUNNIEST PART WAS-- WAS THE DIALOGUE I HAD, I WAS BASICALLY DOING IT-- DOING IT-- PHONETICALLY. >> I TOLD YOU THEY ARE STILL IN THE DARK AGES. I'M ALREADY NOT A GREAT ACTOR TO START WITH, BUT HERE, IT WAS LIKE-- LIKE ROBOTIC ACTING. >> I'LL DO THIS THING ABOUT THIS LITTLE FASHION COMPANY 'CAUSE I WANNA DO STUFF WITH FASHION 'CAUSE I LIKE CLOTHES AND SEXY CLOTHES ON GIRLS. IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE, AND I'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE MOUSEY GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER AND SHE'LL JUST-- SHE'LL REALLY BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE OPERATION. AND WE'LL DO THIS LIKE NORMAL, LIKE TV SHOW KIND OF THING. BUT THAT MORPHED INTO A FETISH FASHION COMPANY AND THE GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER WAS BELLADONNA WHO SENDS THE GUY SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE AN EXTREME S&M DVD WHERE HE FINDS THIS STUFF WITH EASTER EGGS ON THE DVD. IT MORPHED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY LIKE A PRIMER FOR S&M SEX. WHEREAS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD THING, BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD SOMEHOW. 305 ROLLS OF FILM AS I RECALL. AND MOST OF THOSE WERE THE FOUR MINUTES, ALTHOUGH, WE DID HAVE ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS, WE HAD THE BIG CAMERA WHICH COULD SHOOT 11 MINUTES AT A TIME WHICH WAS SO GREAT, 11 MINUTES. I DON'T THINK I'VE DONE MY BEST MOVIE YET, THAT'S FOR SURE. I HOPE TO BE DOING MY NEXT MOVIE IS GONNA BE MY BEST MOVIE, >> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY? >> I'D LIKE A MASSAGE. >> WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. >> I MADE THE ORIGINAL \"MASSEUSE\" IN ABOUT 1990 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT WAS REALLY A DEPARTURE >> HELLO, THIS IS JIM. >> I THINK IT IS THE BEST I FELT SO INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE SCRIPT, >> THE DIRECTNESS, THE SIMPLICITY, THE TRUTHFULNESS OF IT. THERE'S NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. IT'S JUST A MASSEUSE AND HER CLIENT TALKING. YOU KNOW, WHAT DID I CALL IT-- \"MY DINNER WITH ANDRE\" OF X-RATED MOVIES. >> IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE CLOSELY, YOU CAN ALMOST SEE ME, THE REAL ME, DISCOVERING MYSELF. SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT SO MUCH. HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> 28. >> GIRLFRIEND? >> CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET? >> SURE, I LOVE SECRETS. >> I'M A VIRGIN. >> I LIKE TO STAB AND SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO. PAUL THOMAS HAS A WAY ABOUT HIM, AND I THINK I GAINED A LITTLE BIT OF HIS RESPECT. HE'S USED TO BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE POP, POP, POP, POP, POP. AND I WOULD BE LIKE, \"LISTEN, NO, THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE, AND THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\" >> SHE BROUGHT A LOT TO THE TABLE, SHE LISTENED TO ME, ALWAYS ON TIME-- I'M THE ONE WHO HAD TO STEP UP MY GAME. YOU KNOW, WITH JENNA, NO PARTYING, YOU KNOW? >> I'LL SEE YOU LATER, >> I PLAYED JUSTINE JONES, JONES,\" AND JENNA JAMESON PLAYED THE DEVIL, WHICH WAS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE I GOT THE SCRIPT AND THEN HEARD THAT AND MY-- MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO REMAKE THIS AMAZING CLASSIC FILM, \"THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES,\" BUT ALSO NOW NEXT TO JENNA JAMESON >> AT FIRST IT FEELS LIKE A NO-WIN SITUATION, YOU KNOW? WHAT AM I GONNA MAKE ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET \"GODFATHER TWO,\" BUT MOST OF THE TIME, THE SEQUEL'S JUST AREN'T SO GOOD IF THE ORIGINAL'S >> I HAD BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME. AND PAUL THOMAS CALLED ME ONE NIGHT AND SAID, \"WE'RE GONNA DO A REMAKE OF 'THE DEVIL AND I SAID, \"WELL, VERY GOOD, PAUL, CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD LUCK,\" AND SO FORTH. AND HE SAYS, \"YOU'RE GONNA BE IN IT,\" AND I SAID, \"OH, NO, I'M NOT.\" AND HE SAID, \"OH, YES, YOU ARE.\" HE SAYS, \"YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO A CAMEO, THREE LINES.\" I SAID, \"I DON'T EVEN WANNA LEARN THREE LINES.\" HE SAYS, \"I'LL GIVE YOU $10,000,\" I SAID, \"OKAY.\" >> WHEN SHE COMES OUT AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE, YOU GET CHILLS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS. IT REALLY WORKS, AND, UH... SHE'S JUST DELIGHTFUL. >> DO YOU READ, MISS JONES? >> ONLY ROMANCE NOVELS, IT'S MY JOB. >> YOU ARE SO PRIVILEGED. AND YOU FEEL SO SORRY FOR YOURSELF. IS ONE OF THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING WOMEN EVER. OWNING HER SEXUALITY AND NOT BACKING DOWN AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS FAME-- UBER FAMOUS. I HAVE ULTIMATE RESPECT FOR HER, AND I MADE SURE I TOLD HER THAT. AND HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, TOO. >> IT WAS REALLY COOL TO DO THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME, WE WERE THREE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE BUSINESS, AND IT WAS LIKE, \"WOW, THIS >> WHILE I'M GETTING DP'D, I SAY THIS MONOLOGUE FROM-- THAT GEORGINA SPELVIN SAID IN THE ORIGINAL \"MISS JONES.\" >> IF YOU TOUCH ME, I'LL COME, I KNOW I WILL. TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME. I'LL MAKE YOU COME, TOO. SO WHEN I DID HOWARD STERN, HE SAID, \"WELL, DID YOU FUCK A SNAKE,\" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THE ORIGINAL MISS JONES. THEY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH, BUT THEY REMEMBER THE SNAKE SCENE. AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY REMEMBER ABOUT IT, BUT THEY THINK MOSTLY THAT THERE WAS A SEX SCENE WITH A SNAKE. SO I WENT TO VIVID AND I SAID, \"LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO A SNAKE SCENE.\" >> IT WAS A GOOD TIME IN EVERYONE'S LIVES. THEY WERE TIGHT. VIVID WAS TIGHT. WE WERE ALL TIGHT AND WORKING-- REALLY WORKING BOTH FOR \"THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES\" AND FOR \"MASSEUSE\", WORKING AT THE TOP OF OUR PROFESSIONAL LEVELS AND OUR PERSONAL LIVES. WE'RE ALL PRETTY DAMN TOGETHER. SO IT WAS NOTHING BUT-- NOTHING BUT POSITIVE. >> THE 2000s WERE THE DECADE WHEN PORN GREW UP. FLUSH WITH MONEY FROM THE DVD BOOM, PRODUCERS BEGAN SHOOTING BIGGER MOVIES WITH MAJOR BUDGETS, GIGANTIC CASTS, AND ELABORATE SCRIPTS. THESE ADULT BLOCKBUSTERS NEEDED A BETTER FORMAT THAN SIMPLE VIDEO, AND FILM WAS BECOMING TOO COSTLY TO JUSTIFY. COMING WITH ITS OWN SET OF TECHNICAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS, THE FAST-GROWING HD FORMAT >> THE FEATURES OF THAT TIME, WERE PEOPLE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON THEM... >> YEAH. >> WHEN IT WAS NEW, WERE THEY-- >> YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE, FIRST FEATURE LEADS WAS FOR \"WICKED.\" IT WAS THIS REALLY BIG, LIKE, MICHAEL RAVEN MOVIE. I REMEMBER IT HAD, LIKE, THESE OOZING, LIKE, TENTACLE DILDOS AND FOG MACHINE, AND, LIKE, THESE BIG SETS AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW, WE SHOT OUT IN THE DESERT AND IT WAS, LIKE, A WIND STORM AND IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY FUN TO GO FROM, LIKE, JUST GETTING, LIKE, YOU KNOW... >> NAILED. >> FUCK-NAILED ON A GONZO SET, JUST POUNDED, LIKE, \"YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, COME ON, I CAN TAKE IT,\" YOU KNOW, TO, LIKE, CATERING. (LAUGHING) YOU KNOW, LIKE, \"WOULD YOU LIKE A SNACK?\" \"YES, I WOULD.\" >> THERE'S BREAKFAST ON SET? >> SO HOW HAS INTERNET AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY TODAY? >> I THINK IT MAKES THE FANS ACCESS YOUR FAVORITE STARS AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND GIVE THEM GIFTS AND, YOU KNOW, JUST TO TALK TO WHOEVER YOU'RE A FAN OF. SO THE INTERNET, LITERALLY, THEY CAN SEE WHO'S SHOOTING WHEN, THAT DAY, THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA COME OUT. IT'S JUST, LIKE, RIGHT NOW, >> I'M LOOKING FOR A PIRATE. >> WE KNOW MANY, MANY PIRATES. >> BY FAR, THE BIGGEST PRODUCTION THAT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN HAD TO BE THE \"PIRATES.\" SHOT STUFF IN L.A., THEN TOOK THE WHOLE TROOP, CREW, EVERYBODY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN IT ALL THE WAY TO FLORIDA. WE SHOT ON THE U.S.S. BOUNTY. IT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO SHOOT >> HELMSMAN, PREPARE TO SET SAIL. >> ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LET HER GO UNSCATHED, SIR? >> OF COURSE NOT. >> WORKING WITH JOONE, HE HAS A VISION, HE'S AN ARTIST. HE HAS THIS GREAT VISION OF SOMETHING BIGGER >> THERE'S SOME DIRECTORS THAT ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED IN THEIR STUFF, THEY HAVE THE VISION IN THEIR HEAD, AND JOONE IS ONE OF THOSE DIRECTORS. HE ALREADY HAD THE SET IN HIS HEAD AND THEY BUILT IT AND THEY TOOK THEIR TIME TO DO IT AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED. ALREADY HAD THE SHOTS IN HIS HEAD. >> IT'S A BIT SLOW TONIGHT, IT'S AWKWARD. >> LINE UP THE CREW ON THE BOW. BRING ME THE PASSENGERS FROM THE DECK BELOW. AND, SERENA, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOUR METHODS, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER KILLING >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER A CRUEL PIRATE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO WATCH THAT AGAIN... UH, WAS I A CRUEL-- SHE WAS A HORNY PIRATE. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS CRUEL. >> WELL, THERE'S THE VICIOUS LADY I REMEMBER. >> DON'T EVER SECOND-GUESS ME. >> HE BUILT THE TENSION. SO WE WERE, OF COURSE, THE LAST SCENE OF \"PIRATES.\" HE JUST WAITED, AND THEY WOULD SAY LITTLE THINGS TO US TO LIKE GET US READY AND TURNED-ON AND READY TO GO. >> THEY KEPT JESSE JANE AND I SEPARATE, UH, SEPARATED JUST SO THE TENSION AND THE, YOU KNOW, THE ANTICIPATION WOULD BUILD UP AND... >> AND HE'S COME TEASE ME. \"I WONDER WHO'S GONNA WIN? I GUESS SHE'S GONNA SHOW YOU.\" >> SHE'S ABOUT HALF MY SIZE AND THIS LITTLE-- THIS LITTLE CUPCAKE THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA... DOMINATE ME? I HAD TO-- I HAD TO PUT HER IN HER PLACE, BUT I LET HER PRETEND TO THINK THAT FOR A LITTLE BIT. >> OKAY, SO CARMEN GETS PUT-- CHOKED OFF THE BOAT BY TOMMY GUNN. >> AND THEY WANTED TO DO THIS STUNT WHERE, UH, STUNT GIRL GOES OFF IN THE WATER, NO BIG DEAL. >> AND SHE GOES, \"NO.\" >> WELL, JESSE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. SHE WANTED TO DO THE STUNT HERSELF. >> AND OF COURSE, I'M A DAREDEVIL, SO I'M LIKE, \"I'LL DO IT.\" >> AND I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS. SO I ALREADY GOT MY STUFF OFF, GOT MY BOOTS OFF, AND I'M JUST STANDING HERE AND JUST WAITING FOR HER TO JUMP IN. AS SOON AS SHE JUMP IN AND THEY GOT THE SHOT AND THE SPLASH, I'M IN THE WATER AFTER HER. THEY'RE NOT EVEN THINKING THAT THIS BIG, BALLOONING DRESS IS JUST GONNA SUCK UP RIGHT TO HER, AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO KICK, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. >> WELL, MY DRESS, HER DRESS, GETS CAUGHT ON A NAIL UNDERNEATH THE BOAT AND I START SINKING AND I CAN'T COME UP. >> BUT SHE WENT IN AND SHE ALMOST DROWNED. >> I THINK SOME OF THAT WAS BEHIND-THE-SCENES, NOT ALL OF IT WHERE I WAS DROWNING, 'CAUSE THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT GOOD. I DEFINITELY DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE AS BIG AS IT WAS AND THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER. AND PEOPLE WHO EVER WATCHED PORN HEARD OF THE MOVIE AND WENT TO WATCH IT. IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE TO BE CUT INTO A RATED R VERSION AND RENTED IN BLOCKBUSTER. IT WAS A BLOCKBUSTER HIT. >> YOU MUST THINK ME A MONSTER. >> \"CORRUPTION\" WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST BIG-BUDGET MOVIE I WAS THAT INVOLVED IN. I'D, YOU KNOW, BEEN IN OTHER BIG-BUDGET MOVIES AS TALENT, BUT YOU'RE NOT AS INVOLVED YOU SHOW UP AND, YOU KNOW, YOU PRETTY MUCH DO YOUR THING >> IT WAS SOMETHING BEING DONE AND BEING DONE WELL AND WITH, LIKE, HEART. THAT, LIKE, ATTRACTS ME. YEAH, I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME. >> I ALSO HAD A PRETTY DECENT ACTING ROLE. AND THAT WAS PLAYING THE PART OF CAROLYN HELMS, WHO WAS THE SENATOR'S WIFE. AND SHE'S KIND OF THE CENTRAL PART OF THE MOVIE. HERE'S CAROLYN IN THE MIDDLE, AND SHE'S KIND OF STARTS MANIPULATING EVERYBODY >> I'M A UNION LEADER, A TEAMSTER. AND I'M A-- I'M TRYING TO WORK, TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE. WORD IS YOU'RE PLANNING A RUN AT THE BIG TICKET IN TWO YEARS. IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MONEY, US, AND GOD ON YOUR SIDE... IN THAT ORDER. I'M BEING BLACKMAILED IN THIS SCENE, SO I'M-- SO I'M DOING-- I'M PERFORMING A SEXUAL ACT THAT IF I GET CAUGHT, MY OWN CAREER WOULD BE DONE. SO I WAS-- IT WAS ANOTHER SCENE OF HUMILIATION FOR ME, WHICH I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IN MY OWN LIFE WITH TWO MARRIAGES BEHIND ME. >> HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY PUSH ME OUT OF THE CAR? HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY ALMOST HIT ME WITH THE CAR? >> I THINK THEY WERE JUST HAVING FUN THROWING JAMES OUT OF A CAR. >> I HAD TO BE LIKE LIMP AND GET THROWN OF THIS CAR, UM, ONTO A PILE OF GARBAGE. >> I THINK THEY MUST'VE SHOT THAT SCENE. FOR WHATEVER REASON, LIKE 15 TIMES. >> IT FELT LIKE FOREVER 'CAUSE I'D BEEN PUSHED OUT OF THE CAR IN TO GARBAGE. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME WHERE, UH, MY LEGS FELT A LITTLE WEIRD AND, LIKE, EVERYONE STARTED SCREAMING 'CAUSE THE CAR ALMOST ROLLED OVER MY ANKLE. >> IT WAS FUN, IT WAS FANTASTIC BECAUSE WE'D ALL WORKED SO HARD ON IT AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS SENSE OF FAMILY AND HARD WORK, AND THE MOVIE JUST LOOKED INCREDIBLE. AND THEN WE WON. AND I REMEMBER JUMPING UP WHEN WE WON AT THE AVN AWARDS AND I HAD A CORSET ON AND I WAS SO EXCITED AND I ACTUALLY PEED >> WOW. THAT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO GOD I'VE EVER FELT. >> I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S... IT'S A LOT BIGGER AND A LOT IT WAS MY FIRST LEAD, BIG FEATURE FILM LIKE THAT. I HAD DONE THE SMALLER ONES WHERE I WAS LIKE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. BUT THIS WAS LIKE-- IT REALLY PUT ME ON THE MAP AS FAR MY PARTNER DIES, LIKE, IN THE LINE OF DUTY. I'M DEVASTATED. BUT I'M KIND OF LIKE A HARD-ASS, TOO, AND I DON'T LET ANYBODY KIND OF SEE MY EMOTIONS. AND WE DISCOVER THIS HACKER GIRL, WHICH WAS PLAYED BY HILLARY SCOTT. AT THAT POINT, SEXY PICTURES HAD JUST SIGNED HILLARY TO UNDER CONTRACT. AND THEY TOLD US WE HAD TO USE HER. IN THE END, HILLARY DID AN AMAZING JOB. SHE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW... SHE WAS PREPARED AND SHE CAME AND WHO AM I KIDDING? SHE DID NOT WORK HARD AT ALL. SHE DIDN'T, I'M LYING TO TRY THROUGH THE MIRACLE OF EDITING AND GOOD ACTING COACHING, I THINK THAT SHE FILLED THE ROLE FINE. >> DAVID, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. >> SHOWED UP ON SET AND I WAS LIKE, \"OH, THIS IS A BIG MOVIE, AND THEY'RE LIKE, \"YEAH, YOU'RE LIKE THE STAR OF IT.\" I'M LIKE, \"BUT I'M ONLY HERE FOR A DAY.\" AND THEY'RE LIKE, \"WELL, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT THE STAR OF IT, YOU'RE JUST-- THE WHOLE >> YOU SEE A LOT OF MOVIES IN PORN WHERE THEY SAY, \"WE SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS, WE SPEND $2 MILLION,\" WHATEVER THE CASE IS. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT FOR THE MOST PART, THEY LIE. PEOPLE WILL SAY, \"WE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY,\" AND THEY USUALLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. NOW LET ME TELL YOU, \"UPLOAD\" COST $350,000. THAT'S AN UNHEARD OF AMOUNT OF MONEY IN PORN. WE SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER KNOWN A PORN MOVIE THAT SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. >> WHEN \"UPLOAD\" WON ALL THE AWARDS, PICKED UP PRETTY MUCH ALMOST EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AT AVN'S, I FELT LIKE SUCH A STRONG FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED FROM ELI CROSS IS HE SAID, \"THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU NEED, YOU NEED MONEY AND TIME. AND THOSE TWO THINGS WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU WITH A BETTER MOVIE.\" WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAD AND TURN IT INTO TIME, AND THAT MADE FOR A BETTER MOVIE. >> WHATEVER YOU ASK... I AM YOUR SERVANT. \"FALLEN\" TO THIS DAY IS IN \"FALLEN\" I AM A GUARDIAN ANGEL AND MY CHARGE IS JENNA HAZE. (EXPLOSION) >> NO! I THEN LOSE MY WINGS, AND I'M SORT OF ROAMING THE EARTH IN LIMBO IF YOU WILL. AND I PRETTY MUCH HAVE SEX WITH EVERYONE IN MY PATH. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT FANTASY REALM, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AND A LOVE STORY AT THAT WITH ALL THIS FANTASY STUFF WITH ANGELS AND FLYING AROUND ON ROOFTOPS, IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY >> OH! OH! >> A LOT HAS CHANGED. I'M NO LONGER AN ANGEL. \"FALLEN\", I THINK WE SHOT IT OVER TWO WEEKS, BUT IT WASN'T EVERY DAY OF THOSE TWO WEEKS. WE HAD PREP DAYS AND THEN WE HAD DOWN DAYS, SO-- SO PEOPLE COULD REST THEIR PARTS, YOU KNOW? WE HAD A LOT OF REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE IN IT. IT HAD ACTING, IT HAD A REALLY GREAT STORYLINE. IT HAD A LOT OF SEX. IT HAD A LOT OF HARDER SEX, TOO. >> A LOT OF \"FALLEN\" TAKES PLACE ON ROOFTOPS, AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN CAMERA. I'M-- I'M SCARED OF GREEN SCREEN MYSELF. I THINK \"FALLEN\" STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. IT'S A GREAT STORY. IT KIND OF PROPELLED JESSICA INTO THAT SUPERSTAR STATUS. AND, UH, DIDN'T DO BAD FOR ME AS A DIRECTOR, AS WELL. THE REAL REASON TO DO \"FALLEN\" WAS TO KIND OF HAVE JESSICA HIT THAT OTHER LEVEL. AND IT'S GREAT IF YOU CAN PUT HER IN THIS GREAT MOVIE. BUT IF THE SEX FALTERS, THEN IT'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T DONE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH YOUR STARLET BY TAKING HER >> WHAT HAPPENED? >> NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE. THEY CALL IT THE BIG BURN. AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY, >> WHEN I THINK OF A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD, UH, IT'S MORE THAN JUST BROKEN DOWN BUILDINGS. THERE'S A PRIMAL ELEMENT TO IT WHERE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM EACH OTHER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, AND LIFE BECOMES CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH >> MY CHARACTER WAS BASICALLY BEING SEX TRAFFICKED IN POST-APOCALYPTIC, UH-- I DON'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY I MEAN, JUST POST-APOCALYPTIC EARTH. >> YOU A BUTCHER NOW, TOO? >> SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE PRINCE. HE GETS FIRST LOOK AT ALL MY TRADE. >> \"THE 8TH DAY\" WAS CONCEIVED BY ME WITH AMBER RAYNE IN MIND AS THE LEAD CHARACTER. SHE IS THE SCRUFFY TANK GIRL IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. BUT IT WAS PERCEIVED BY EVERYONE THAT KAYDEN, BEING ADAM & EVE'S CONTRACT GIRL, WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW. AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS THE BOX COVER, BUT SHE IS THE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. AND, UM, WHEN AWARDS TIME CAME OUT, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. AMBER GOT SUPPORTING ACTRESS NOMINEE AND KAYDEN GET, YOU KNOW, ACTRESS NOMINEE. >> \"THE 8TH DAY\" WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST MOVIE I'VE EVER WORKED ON. THERE WERE SOME DAYS WHERE WE HAD STARTED THE DAY BEFORE. THERE WERE EXAMPLES IN THE MOVIE OF, UM, LIKE A MARKETPLACE, LIKE A BAZAAR THAT WE HAD TO BUILD WHERE PEOPLE WERE HAWKING JUNK OR THEY WERE HAWKING FOOD OR CLOTHES, THINGS THAT THEY'D SCAVENGED. >> THAT WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AS FAR AS ART DIRECTION WAS CONCERNED. THE ART DIRECTOR, KYLIE IRELAND, SPENT WEEKS RUNNING AROUND L.A. FINDING STUFF TO DO THERE. MY FAVORITE KAYDEN MOMENT, UM, IN THE WHOLE SHOW WAS WHEN SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BREAK DOWN AND CRY ABOUT HER DAD. >> IT WAS BEFORE I LEARNED HOW TO CRY BY MYSELF. >> AND CAN'T GET ANY TEARS TO FLOW AT ALL. WE WAITED A GOOD LONG TIME, AT LEAST A HALF AN HOUR. I WALK BACK IN AND I SAID, \"YOU GOT NOTHING?\" SHE GOES, \"NO, NOTHING BAD'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.\" >> I THINK THEY SQUIRTED CITRUS JUICE OR SOME SORT OF CITRUSY FRUIT IN MY EYES TO MAKE IT GO. >> SHE SAID, \"HOLY SHIT, LET'S SHOOT RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE GOD DAMN IT, THIS BURNS.\" AND I SAID, \"PERFECT.\" >> MY DAD DID THIS. (CRYING) ALL OF THIS. >> AND SHE GOES, \"WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?\" I SAID, \"FUCK YOU, YOUR LIFE'S PERFECT.\" NO WONDER YOU CAN'T CRY. >> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AFTER THE BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS THAT WENT INTO IT, IT WAS REALLY A NICE PAYOFF. IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS. IT WASN'T JUST US, YOU KNOW, FUCKING AROUND IN THE DESERT. 'CAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT >> HOW DID MY FATHER DIE? >> A YOUNG JEDI NAMED DARTH VADER, WHO WAS A PUPIL OF MINE, OFF AND LEFT HIM BURNING IN A RIVER OF LAVA. >> \"STAR WARS\" IS PROBABLY THE AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO PARODY IN IT, SO, UM... WE REALLY DID-- WE REALLY DID, THAT COULD BE HAD, EVERYTHING SINGLE REFERENCE THAT WE COULD HAVE, AND RECREATING A LOT OF THE SCENES. IT WAS REALLY A LOT OF FUN. IT'S A LOT OF WORK, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. >> SHOOT FIRST, SHOOT OFTEN. SORRY FOR THE MESS. HAD TO KNOW \"STAR WARS\" TO ONE, GET THE HUMOR. TRYING TO GO WITH IT AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH STILL KIND OF TRYING TO STICK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT. >> THE THING THAT ALL THE FANS WOULD ASK ME IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I ANNOUNCE THE MOVIES, LIKE, OKAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE GIRL IN \"STAR WARS.\" YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PORN MOVIE-- TO THIS DAY, PEOPLE WRITE ON YOUTUBE, THEY WATCH, YOU KNOW, THEY READ ABOUT IT LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE ONLY ONE GIRL? IT'S NOT TRUE, WE FOUND OTHER GIRLS THAT ARE PART OF THE \"STAR WARS\" UNIVERSE. THE GIRLS IN THE CANTEEN, I MEAN, THERE'S-- THERE'S A TON OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER, IT'S WAS REALLY INTERESTING. >> YOU CAN FIND SEX IN ANYTHING. I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE OR THE THEME HAS TO BE SEXY TO MAKE IT SEXY. THAT'S OUR JOB, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE THINGS THAT AREN'T SEXY SEXY. >> DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED, YOUR HIGHNESS. >> I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M DISGUSTED. WE SAT IN A ROOM AND HE TALKED INTO A POT. WE RECORDED ALL HIS SOUND IN A GIANT POT, LIKE A SPAGHETTI POT. IT WAS HILARIOUS. >> EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA. AND IN \"STAR WARS\" IT WAS LIKE CHI CHI LARUE. >> I'M SAVED! OVER HERE. HEY, SAILOR! >> C-3PO HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY METROSEXUAL, AND I FIGURE WE TAKE IT, YOU KNOW, TO PARODY THAT, TO EXPLORE THAT. >> \"STAR WARS\" WON A TOTAL OF EIGHT AWARDS AT AVN WHICH IS THE MOST THAT ANY PARODY HAS EVER WON, AND I THINK THAT'S AMAZING. IT'S CRAZY, UM, AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING ABOUT THAT IS MOST OF ALL THAT-- ALL THE WORK FOR THE MOVIE WAS DONE BEHIND-THE-SCENES, WITHOUT THE SETS, WITHOUT THE COSTUMES, WITHOUT THE TIME AND DEDICATION FOR THE SCRIPT. THE SHOOTING, THE ANGLES, THE GREEN SCREEN, THE POST PRODUCTION. THE MOVIE WOULD'VE BEEN NOTHING. AND I THINK, UM, YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY SHOWS AND, YOU KNOW, BY WINNING EIGHT AVN AWARDS, IT DEFINITELY SHOWS THAT OTHER PEOPLE APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD >> MOST KNOW ME AS DEATH. >> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? >> I'VE COME FOR YOU. >> THE BASIS BEHIND \"UNDERWORLD--\" I PLAY A CHARACTER NAMED TANYA, AND I HAVE BEEN WITH MY FIANCÉ AND WE HAVE MADE THE SWEET LOVE, TO DRIVE ME HOME, WE'RE IN HIS PARKING GARAGE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'RE VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT MUGGING. >> SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR BOYFRIEND. >> NO, PLEASE! >> THE OPENING IS, UH, A BIT DRASTIC AND A BIT BLOODY AND VIOLENT, UH, BUT WE ACTUALLY WENT BACK AND FORTH ON HOW VIOLENT TO MAKE IT. >> AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAVE MY LIFE, I'M PUT UNDER ANESTHESIA. AND WHEN I GO UNDER ANESTHESIA, THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS THAT, GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ME FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO ME IN THE UNDERWORLD. >> IF YOU REALLY WATCH THE MOVIE, EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH IS-- HAS A MIRROR IMAGE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE UNDERWORLD BELOW. EVERYTHING'S KIND OF TIED IN AND EVERYTHING'S, UH, GOT A YING AND A YANG SORT OF THING. >> XANDER CORVUS PLAYS SLICE AND HE WAS SORT OF, UH, HE HAD SCALPEL FINGERS AND HE WAS UP ON STILTS AND SO HE WAS THE SCALPEL THAT WAS STARTING THE SURGERY. >> THIS JOURNEY THAT YOU'VE EMBARKED UPON IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS SELF REACTING TO THE WORLD AROUND IT. >> THE NURSE WAS PASSING THE GAUZE TO THE DOCTOR. DURING MY OPERATION IT FELL. AND AS IT DROPPED, YOU SEE AN AERIALIST FALL OUT OF THE SKY >> SO ME AND JESSICA DRAKE GOT TO HAVE SEX ON WATER, OR IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS DIRECTLY ON THE WATER, BUT IT WAS WAS BUILT AND, UH, THERE WAS MAYBE LIKE AN INCH OF WATER ON TOP OF IT. >> AND I'M BLOODY IN A SHALLOW POOL OF WATER FOR LIKE EIGHT HOURS THAT DAY. >> WHEN THE INTIMIDATION MELTED AWAY WAS WHEN SHE STUMBLED ON A FEW OF HER LINES AND LAUGHED AT HERSELF. AND THEN YOU REALIZE, LIKE, SOMEONE'S A HUMAN BEING, AND THEY'RE A NORMAL PERSON AND... THAT'S OKAY. >> OH, I LOVE HAVING SEX WITH ASA AKIRA. RIGHT BEFORE THE SCENE, WE'RE TAKING PRETTY GIRLS AND I'M LIKE, \"OH, THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY FUN.\" WE JUST SORT OF GOT ON EACH OTHER AND ROLLED OFF THE SET. WE DID IT EVERYWHERE. LIKE, WE WERE JUST HAVING SEX, SO, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO, UH, >> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT? >> I MEAN, WHAT ELSE IS THERE APART FROM LUXURY? >> THAT CAN'T BE A SERIOUS QUESTION. >> AN INDIE PORNO, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT. IT'S-- IT'S LIKE A REAL MOVIE WITH EMOTION AND ACTING IT'S PORN WITH A REAL STORYLINE. >> WHY DID YOU COME? >> I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN. >> WHY DID YOU COME AFTER FIVE FUCKING YEARS? MY CHARACTER, HER NAME'S JACKY. SHE'S THE BADASS. SHE'S DEFINITELY THE BADASS OF THE MOVIE AND SHE, UH, IS TRYING TO OPEN THE OTHER LILY UP TO THIS WORLD >> MY ROLE IN \"WASTELAND\" WAS VERY SIMPLE. THERE'S TWO GIRLS AT THE BAR. I SAY SOMETHING IN THEIR EARS WHICH IS EASY FOR ME. TAKE HER UP TO THE BATHROOM AND HAVE SEX WITH LILY LABEAU IN THE BATHROOM. IT'S A VERY, VERY CLOSED ENVIRONMENT, IT'S LITERALLY REAL TOILET SO THERE WAS NO ROOM TO OPEN THE DOOR, SHOOT, LIKE, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR. THEY SHOT IT ALL FROM ABOVE. I THINK HE KNEW THAT THE BEST WAY TO USE ME IS NOT TO HAVE ME SPEAK BUT LET ME JUST FUCK. >> I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT SEPARATES \"WASTELAND\" FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER PORN IS THAT THE SHOTS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND THEY ARE THOUGHT OUT. EVERY SINGLE SHOT IS THOUGHT OUT AND PLANNED TO JUST-- >> IT WAS REALLY, REALLY DARK, UM, WHERE WE SHOT THAT SCENE, FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SHOT ANYTHING IN SUCH DARK LIGHTING. IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY DARK. I WAS LIKE, \"REALLY, LIKE, CAN YOU GUYS REALLY SEE WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING?\" THEY'RE LIKE, \"YEAH, YEAH, IT LOOKS COOL.\" >> IT'S THIS WHOLE STORY COMBINING TO MAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL JUDGMENT HAD REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. AND RIGHT WHEN MY GUARD WAS FULLY DOWN, IT SUDDENLY HAD POPPED BACK UP. >> EMMA GOES INTO INTERVIEW A MAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM FITZGERALD WHO IS THIS VERY PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN WHO EMPLOYS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALES. THERE'S AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION PROPOSITIONS HER FOR THE ROLE OF BEING HIS SUB. SHE'S NOT A VERY SEXUAL PERSON. SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T CONFORM TO NORMAL SOCIETY'S VIEWS >> I DIDN'T READ THE \"50 SHADES OF GREY\" BOOK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER JACKY WE WANNA DO PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. >> I READ \"50 SHADES OF GREY\" AND I HATED HOW THE FEMALE PROTAGONIST WAS PORTRAYED. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY WEAK AND HER ENTIRE MOTIVATION WAS TO PLEASE A MAN AND TO MAKE A MAN HAPPY. I WANTED TO SET ABOUT WRITING A BDSM STORY THAT REALLY EXPLORED A STRONG WOMAN'S SUB ROLE AND HOW THAT CAN BE SO EMPOWERING FOR HER. >> SHE WAS, UM, LIVING, LIKE, A KIND OF RESERVED LIFE AND NOT REALLY BEING HERSELF, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN VERY MUCH RELATE TO BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO JUST, LIKE, BE THE PERSON THAT EVERYONE WANTED ME TO BE. >> BDSM IS NOT JUST BEATING SOMEBODY AND HARMING SOMEBODY AND PHYSICALLY HURTING THEM. IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE MENTAL ASPECT OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO FOR ME, I WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT THAT. >> I DID FEEL LIKE, UH, I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE JOINING THE MOVIE BECAUSE I HAD SOME BDSM EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT BONDAGE COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY. SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN A LITTLE BIT OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE WITH THAT FOR A MOVIE THAT SO MUCH, LIKE, REVOLVES AROUND THE BDSM COMMUNITY. >> SO \"THE SUBMISSION OF EMMA MARX\" WON BEST BDSM MOVIE AT AVN. AND I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED BECAUSE WE'RE UP AGAINST BDSM COMPANIES. AND NEW SENSATIONS MAINLY IS A FEATURE GONZO STUDIO THAT DOESN'T REALLY FOCUS ON ANYTHING PARTICULARLY HARDCORE. >> I WAS REALLY FLATTERED THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT FILM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THE PHYSICALITY THAT WAS EXPLORED. IT WAS THE MENTAL ASPECT. >> WHEN I FIRST STARTED, WE WERE DOING FILM, IT WAS A THRILL. IT WAS GREAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE LUGGING THESE BIG ASS CAMERAS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVING A FIELD DAY. NOBODY BOTHERED US, NOBODY CARED, YOU JUST DID THE MOVIES. AND THE DRUGS WERE GREAT. AND VIDEO CAME OUT AND IT WAS-- IT WAS A SMALLER PARTY. YOU DIDN'T NEED THE CREW YOU HAD FOR 35 MILLIMETER. YOU HAD WAY SMALLER CREW, AND YOU WOULD JUST SORT OF LOAD IT IN A VAN, SHOW UP AT A LOCATION, SHOT YOUR FOUR OR FIVE SCENES AND RAN OUT THE DOOR, YOU WERE DONE. AND THE DRUGS WERE OKAY. AND-- AND TOWARD THE END, IT REALLY JUST GOT, \"HOW FAST CAN YOU CRANK IT OUT AND GET IT BACK TO ME AND I GOTTA PEDAL IT...\" AND THE DRUGS SUCKED. >> IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE PORN INDUSTRY WILL GO FROM HERE. THE INTERNET ERA SEEMS TO DEMAND A RETURN TO THE LOOPS AND VIGNETTES THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE EROTIC FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S A SHAME TO THINK THAT THIS LIST OF THE GREATEST ADULT MOVIES MAYBE THE LAST OF ITS KIND. BUT THE FUTURE IS HARD TO SEE. AND MAYBE THE ADULT FEATURE WILL SURPRISE US WITH ITS LONGEVITY.

(2016) - full transcript", "plot": "Documentary sequel that offers a close-up look into the personal lives of the legendary porn stars who've survived the test of time and influenced popular culture. Blends rare interviews ...", "content": "Porn now is a lot more mainstream. - Fuck, yeah. - Yes, yes, yes! It's allowed me to live a really great life. - Bam! - We're performers. Just like The Rock and Vin Diesel are action performers. She was beautiful, her scenes were hot, and she was a party girl. The stigma against porn is kind of what drew me to porn. The time in which you might be stigmatized- - by casting someone from the adult film industry I think is just gone. Now you have to bring so much more to be so much less of a name. He was the perfect porn-star. There was just something very innocent- - about us getting naked and having sex on camera. That's why I attribute my longevity to just a lot of classical movies- - from the golden era, and also a lot of mainstream. We realize people have no idea that these are real- - flesh and blood people that're working. It's porn. You're in it. That's it. Adult film stars are just that, Stars. Most people can name one porn-star, - and everybody's seen 'em in action at least once, - and more than that if they're being honest. That makes adult film stars celebrities. Take it from me. I'm Mr. Skin and I filled my own internet empire- - by sharing naked celebrities with the world at large. And tonight we're gonna meet some of the greatest adult film stars of all time. Now, what makes them the greatest? Is it their looks, their sexual prowess, their longevity in the industry, - their ability to cross over to the mainstream? Or is it a combination of all of these things? Well, everyone on this list checks many of those boxes- - as we salute the most famous, most fascinating... ...and all around hottest adult film stars in history. Let's kick it off with some of the most popular porn-stars of all time. When fans name their favorite adult performers... ...these names come right off the tips of everyone's tongues. It's a hall of fame hotter than anything in plain old Hollywood. Fuck me. Yeah. Yeah. Tori was a very strong performer that really kind of blew up very quickly- - and became one of those girls who that year, those two years won everything. I know that Tori has won the Back to Back Female Performer of the Year awards. She's kinky and gorgeous. You can't get any better than that. One of the best natural bodies in the business. Um, and when she's on sexually, wow. Growing up and being really boyish, - I never really imagined that I would be a model at all. Any type of model, let alone this type. This industry really gave me a chance to be my deviant self. Curb your tongue, funny man. She was very good, uh, in front of the camera. Like she has that kind of mainstream believability. Yeah, yeah. Oh. When I appeared on \"Ray Donovan,\" - um, when I came to set, and everybody was very welcoming- - and very warm and curious about the industry. Ooh. Ricky? Camera down. - Hey! - Ugh! I really feel like women's sexuality has been lost in the dark ages, - and I feel like it's really starting to evolve. I want to leave behind that empowering feeling for women. I want women to know that it's okay to be sexual. I want women to know that you can be classy- - and graceful and elegant and smart and sophisticated, and a freak. Like you don't have to leave that off the list- - in order to be the other things. If you have all those things and you're a freak, you are unstoppable. I think Christy is a superstar. I don't think there's any question. I think Christy's a big star for a lot of reasons. - First of all... - She had massive tits. And that always helps. And they were natural. Natural massive tits. And that helps ever more. How I became a star in this business- - is beyond me, but when I look back, - you had to like me 'cause there were only four of us to choose from. I was like, - the big titted girl next door. She was genuinely a very stunning, beautiful woman, - so I don't think it was solely just 'cause there was only a few of them. You know, that first time was with Ron Jeremy, I mean, and it was so porno-y. She knew how to talk dirty during sex. She just sort of knew what was on your mind. - Do you wanna fuck me? - Oh, yeah. Do you wanna stick your cock in my pussy? She was a good comedienne. She doesn't take herself too seriously. You get your makeup done, - you suck a dick, you'd have a catered lunch. So if it was my choice, she probably would've been my number one pick back in the day. She had it all. I'm Christy Canyon. Back in, back in the day, goddammit, that meant something. It was like the perfect storm. She could act, she wanted to do it, - her scenes were good, she had giant boobs. I just always like morphed into something else in this business. I mean, from making films to dancing to writing my book to radio for ten years, - I just showed up, did my job, had great sex and got my $200- - and felt like I owned the world. I started doing adult films in 1999. You know, in the beginning, she kind of looked like- - a Vietnamese war vet without makeup. You put makeup on her and she had a soft body- - and all natural and gorgeous boobs. Because for so long we really only exploited the sexuality- - of people that had fake boobs and blonde hair. I feel like Tera Patrick was like just a magnificent supermodel. She came off very confident, - and like her body and her gorgeousness matched it. You know, we never really stayed in the adult bubble when we were marketing her. We thought we can get her out there to everybody. This girl is somebody that everybody will love, and everybody did. She was on the cover of \"FHM\" and the cover of \"Maxim\"- - and all the men's magazines. When I started independently, I did a lot of gonzo movies, - and I remember fans always saying, - oh my gosh, why are you doing Gonzo movies? You should be doing these like big features. And I was like, are you kidding me? I just wanna go and have sex. It really was about the sex. I think I was one of her first Girl/Girl scenes, - so I was just more nervous on the fact of, you know, - she's Tera Patrick, and she's so much taller than me, too. Like my face was at her vagina. What I liked about working with Vivid was it was the first time where I actually- - completely got creative control over everything I wanted to do in a movie. She's bright and she's articulate, and she's very creative. Ooh, yeah, right. Uh, yeah, you're on my clit. But I've been asked, would you ever come back to porn? What if someone just dropped a million dollars right there- - and said, you and Rocco can have sex in Egypt on the pyramids. I still wouldn't do it. There was only so far I could go, - and I feel like ten years is a good amount of time- - and a long time to be in the porn business. Seka is amazing. She's my all time favorite actress of that era. She's very glamorous. She was strictly business. All business. Very smart girl. She kind of reminded me like of a trashy version of Marilyn Monroe. Would you like to suck on my tits, huh, right there? Ooh. What made me different than anybody else at the time? For one thing, I was the first platinum blonde. I mean, there were other blondes, but not screaming blonde hair. She was working at a porn store, - and she was watching the porn and thought to herself, - I could do way better than this. They have really dirty feet, and they've got pimples on their butts. I said, this is really nasty. I went and made my first adult movie, - and I don't think there was even sound at the time. It was in color, though. I mean, I'm old, but I'm not that old, so it was in color. And having owned adult bookstores, - I knew the stars in the business when I went on set, - and I just felt like a big piece of meat on a hook. \"Prisoner of Paradise\" was kind of fun. I played a German Nazi bitch with a really bad German accent. But I thought, no, she's a southern girl. How's she gonna do a Nazi? But she did. Don't you cum in me, you American swine. Don't cum in me, you American swine. ♪ Oh, seka ♪ ♪ Tried on some sexy clothes ♪ The film itself, \"Inside Seka,\" was an incredibly popular film- - simply because it was one of the films that had been made- - sort of when that porno chic period was ending. And the reason why they were so important is because they were star-centric. Seka has sex with about 20 different guys. She also was given $10,000 as her pay. Around 1982, I decided to stop performing. AIDS was starting to become a real big issue for me. I'd worked for \"Club\" magazine after that for about ten years- - and I traveled around the world stripping, - and I had a great time and made a butt-load of money. I always thought she looked like Raquel Welch when she was younger. So she was beautiful, her scenes were hot, and she was a party girl. That's a really good combination, for a superstar. She wasn't about making movies. She was about fucking. She would show up and just want to have sex, and do her best at that. We can lay music over this, right? - Yeah. - Great. You don't mind just fucking me. Action. The pickin's weren't like it is today. It's not like now where the beautiful hot chicks are a dime a dozen. So I was fresh meat. I was excited about my work. January of '89 I had my first contract with Vivid- - on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Tropicana. It was that simple. Tori Welles was one of the first home video stars of her era. She was then contracted with Vivid, - who loaned her out to Andrew Blake to make \"Night Trips.\" The idea of \"Night Trips\" basically came from my art direction- - and fashion design background. And, uh, I just wanted to make the most beautiful movies that I could- - with the most beautiful talent that was available at the time. He really made her the star like putting her in almost every single scene. It was one of a kind, and it was the most beautiful porn every made at that time. She was like pure sex and a mile wide. It was very trans-formative during that period, and she was at the right time, - the right place, with the right people. The success of \"Night Trips\" it just happened before my eyes, - probably because of the beauty, and sexual prowess of Tori Welles. I made a name accidentally, but because of the drug addiction- - and because of the felonies, and because of things like that, - you're not always able to move on, - you know, so you come back to the adult tit, so to speak. I mean, I had gone from being Tori Welles to like being a P.A. It's like talk about humiliating. So, you know, some of it was good, and some of it was bad, you know. Some of it was stupid. You know, you don't get into this business if, - you know, you're completely got your shit together. You just don't, and I don't care what anybody says. Uh, I actually started working at Hooters when I was 17 years old. You were supposed to be 18, but I kind of was naturally big. Somebody was trying to scout me. They were like, why haven't you done \"Playboy\"? And I was like, I'd rather do porn. And I flew out to L.A. Literally it was on a Friday, - and by the time I came home Sunday, I had a signed contract with Digital Playground. She was almost a star from the moment we signed her. So it wasn't so much a matter of making Jesse Jane a star. It was just a matter of showing the world. And at the time, Seymore Butts had his show, \"Family Business,\" - so he followed me around like a little puppy dog. I have finally tracked you down. Do you know how many times I have seen you? Every time you catch my eye, and I wanna zoom up over to you, - but you disappear as quick as you appear. And now that I just saw you, I just feel like, I just felt like I just had to like get you- - while I knew you were cornered. Are you planning on... Honey, I need you to do an interview. Come do an interview. And then from then, they were like, yep, she's made for porn. She's definitely, you know what? We made a right decision. It's mine to ride when I'm fucking you. Oh, yes. I want the whole package. I want it all. I wanna be the next star. Like the team that I had behind me, - like the marketing and everything was genius. Marketing her was simple. I mean, one image would elicit so many responses- - from the media, and then once people met her in person, - you know, she never disappointed. I saw her do a Girl/Girl in the \"Pirates\" movie that was really intense. It was basically like sex fighting, and I've never seen anything like that. - Fuck, yeah? - I Wanna kiss you. - Yeah? - Slap me harder. Yeah? Yeah? I think that's sort of the quintessential barbie almost. Barbie's been everything. She's been an astronaut. She's been, she's been everything in between. So, yeah, there you go, The Ultimate Porn Barbie. It's all I wanted. Like I wanted to be known as the sex symbol you'll always remember. That when I get out of the business, you'll still know the name Jesse Jane. The average lifespan of an adult female performer's career- - is less than two years, but this next group of stars- - have careers that span from 20 to over 30 years. Now, why have these knockouts lasted in an industry- - that always looks for the next big thing? Because these are the golden goddesses- - whose beauty, passion, and raw sexuality- - transcends all elements, including time. One of the reasons for my longevity is I just would not leave- - when they all wanted me to after five years. Once I hit 30, they sort of, I mean, - I got the AVN Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. It's like you trying to tell me something? When you watch her fuck on film, it is genuine. She also just has that something, that star quality. Nina Hartley really resonates with so many people- - that have become her ardent fans over the years- - because she's so accessible, and she's so honest, and she's so fearless. I've been able to maintain a 30-year-plus career because I basically love the work. But the first time I saw sex onscreen- - my inner cookie monster just said: \"Me want do that.\" Like she had a, uh, kind of a cameo in \"Boogie Nights\"- - that like she really showed what she's made of- - when she does a little bit more mainstream stuff. She played William Macy's wife. She was kind of a sexual free spirit in the movie. She cuckolded him many, many times. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck does it look like I'm doing? Can you close the door? That's my wife, you asshole. For a sex worker, when they try to go out- - and give sex education, to be taken seriously, - I think no one is taken more seriously than Nina. There's her vagina, her urethra, and her clit. So how can I be a feminist and be a sex worker? The bottom line is my body, my rules. And the message on that was whatever you wanna do is okay. That women should not be judged- - for being in this business and being on set- - and having sex with a different person every day. The energy coming at me, the laws coming at me from both the religious right- - and the so-called feminist left are exactly the same. They're prohibitionary. Um, one doesn't want me to have an abortion, and one does not want me to sell- - the services of my vulva for money. I'm a Trojan horse for queer culture. I'm a bisexual, I am kinky and all these things, - but I dress up normal, I look very straight, - and my most fun times are when I get my face- - between the legs of a gay-for-pay girl- - and get a real response out of her. It's like, yes, I am that good. Her being with wicked for so long- - was a lot of the reason for the longevity in her career, and her evolution. I think she's hotter now than she was 15 years ago. But then when you go beyond her physical aspects, - she's a good voice and an advocate for our industry. Because Jessica has been in, so many blockbuster adult movies, - she's one of the few modern adult stars recognizable to the average consumer. Oh, fuck. I was a stripper. I had the luck to run into Blondage, which was Janine and Julia Ann. And I saw them onstage and something clicked. Yeah. A few people from wicked called me, and then I agreed to sign with them. And I also came to realize that the more I personally have to do with the movie, - the happier I am with the outcome. So she won Best Actress, and won this great Hardcore Scene Award. And I think that defines Jessica along the way as well. Even at adult star signings, women are getting in line and telling her- - their sex concerns and issues and problems. And then they started asking me for sex advice, so I saw this opening- - for a different kind of sex-ed, or a different kind of instructional. Jessica drake is unique. For one thing, DVD sales are dying, and her movies still sell great. She's a spokesperson for Wicked, - she's a spokesperson for the entire adult industry. She's a successful sex educator, - has had a ton of mainstream appearances, - and, oh, by the way, still has time, for all her philanthropy. So she's truly unique amongst today's stars. Working with her, the scenes were over way too quickly, - and then, of course, I'm masturbating in my car- - thinking about her driving home. But, PFST, sex with Kylie? Perfect. She's just such a strong, powerful, um, artistic, - and visionary woman in my mind. You know, if she wanted to come back and do films now, - which I would absolutely be there if she would, - she could and she would kill it- - just as if it was 10 or 15 or even 20 years ago. So I suppose you could say I started kind of in this business, - but not in this business when I worked in a video store in San Diego, - and I was in charge of ordering adult movies. And they said, okay, this is randy west you're gonna be working with him, I'm like, - yeah, okay, I know who you are. And I was extremely nervous. I never thought in a million years that I would win best new starlet. I was thrilled that I was nominated. Kylie Ireland. And I have to thank all the people that have believed in me. It was '95 maybe that I signed a contract with Sin City. We started shooting movies, - and we were supposed to do like basically I think it was a movie a month. And suddenly none of us shot anything. I decided I was gonna go to small claims court. I didn't realize at this point that that's where \"Judge Judy\" picked up their cases. You are about to enter the courtroom of judge Judith Sheindlin. Kylie Ireland is an adult movie star. She's suing this producer for breach of contract. - She's not some airhead. - Thank you. And I'm awarding $5,000 to the plaintiff. Remember, there was no internet at the time. Adult stars didn't end up on reality shows. That catapulted her to another level. She was already popular, but now she's, - mainstream people are going, well, who's this women on \"judge Judy\"? She's incredible behind the camera. That's when I started doing production design. I just always wanted to say, I won art direction, - and that didn't happen until we did \"Star Wars XXX.\" I find your lack of faith disturbing. My life is so weird. Sometimes I just sit here and I go, my life is so strange. How bizarre is my life that this is what I'm doing right now? Up till now, we've met some the greatest female stars- - of all time. But you may be asking yourself, where are the men? Okay, let's bring on the biggest studs, - in every sense, in the history of the adult business. We start with john C. Holmes, - whose claim to fame rested between his legs. - Are you really twin brothers? - No, not really. Same father, different mothers. Oh, what a mess. Will someone come here and change the sheet here? Oh, this is disgusting. Oh, that's the same hand, isn't it? - Yeah. - Oh, god. John Holmes definitely impacted pop culture. And especially in the '70s, he was it. He was like a sight to see. 14 inches. And they all wanted to see it. That's what John was. He was a freak. I was sitting there editing, and my partner comes out and he says, Bob, - you gotta come in and see this guy's dick. Wow! I said, man, that's the last thing I wanna do is see a tall skinny guy's dick. I can't paint and I can't draw and I can't sculpt. So I have to have some outlet for my fake artistic qualities. My name is Johnny Wadd. I'm a private detective. It was one of those slow days- - where there was very little money and very little pussy. Basically they get involved with me, for one of one reason. And, uh, it doesn't go beyond that. He quite literally didn't have to do anything, but be John Holmes. He came onto camera and he sat down- - and he leaned back and the girl did what she did. He would say, how much film you got? And have my cameraman could count down, and he could cum on cue. He was that good back in the early days. Not so much later. Why do you stay in the bathroom, for five hours at a time on sets? I don't know. It's a shitty habit. There was a time when he was very troubled. He'd been using drugs a lot, - and the reason we shot \"Prisoner of Paradise\"- - on Kauai was because I thought- - if we can get him away from Los Angeles, it might help him, and it did. His goal in life was just to see- - how many people he could fuck over as fast as he could- - and get out of town without getting killed. On the wonderland murders, Eddie Nash was this very big drug dealer, and john had hooked up. Uh, they heisted all the money and all the drugs from Eddie, - and Eddie found out it was John- - who got him in trouble, - and Eddie said, John's dead. He's like running around the country evading police. They catch him Florida. He's in jail and there's petty theft- - and there's burglary and then there's drug dealing- - and there's pimping and then he's prostituting himself. He's prostituting his girlfriend. He's all over the place doing whatever he can- - to basically keep this habit alive that he has- - that I don't think he ever quite overcame. We the jury, in the above entitled action, - find the defendant, John Curtis Holmes, not guilty of murder. When it came out that he did have AIDS, the shit hit the fan. In the industry that's pretty much the worst thing you can do. You're jeopardizing people's lives, and especially back then. AIDS was a death sentence. It wasn't something you managed. He just told them he had the flu. Typical of John to lie to everybody. Thank god none of them got sick. He was the ultimate gigolo, The ultimate Playboy. The ultimate con man, and that's what he was. Let's go. I want you to brief me before I get involved in this. Yes, sir. He's a consummate professional. He's one of the few guys- - that's had a great balance between, um, chemistry- - and, and raw sexual energy. You know, like he's found a way to be a black man and not come on set- - with like, you know, a bunch of chains and jewelry- - and like an entourage, you know. He comes in, he has a hard dick, he lays it down and, you know, - he leaves a smile on your face. And it's so funny, 'cause he's the sweetest guy. Like he's just really mellow, - and then all of a sudden, he pulls out this monster. Very early out of college I got into finance, - and so I became the proverbial wall street stockbroker, for six years. The broker that trained me brought me to a party, - which was a 19-on-1 gangbang. So I got kind of used to having sex in front of people- - at a very early part of my adulthood. That's why a lot of people buy his stuff, - 'cause they're like, I wanna watch Lex specifically fuck girls. It was just me being myself, but the key ingredient was the casting. Always the absolute best female talent- - available at the moment we were shooting. I think that he is the most successful black performer ever- - because he's just so consistent and so driven. I won Male Performer of The Year 2000, 2002, and 2003, - and one of the things I've gotten out of it- - that has been perhaps more impactful in my life- - has been that I've been the only black performer- - to have won Performer of The Year Award male or female. He's probably one of the few successful black performers- - that owns his own company, and to me, that was very inspiring. For Lex to take his name, and then spin off and do other things, you know. He has his own podcast. He has his own talk show, you know, he has his own toy line. I'm in my 15th year in the major leagues, right, - and it's not really a case where I feel that I'm getting tired of performing, - you know, despite the fact that I may now be more than twice the age- - of some of the youngest performers I work with. I love the fact that, you know, I get to do this. And there's actually a renewed vigor, for performance that I'm undergoing- - because I've gotten to the point where I realize there's only a few guys globally- - that get a chance to perform, and be regarded as the main dudes. I appreciate being a performer more now than when I started my career. Yeah, when I started in Europe, so the three first years I did only in France. So I had to make a choice. I was done with school. What do I do now? Like am I starting being a teacher- - or if I do that, I'm gonna have to really focus on that. He's just very controlling, but passionate in the same way. He's one of the few men that I will let be rough with me, and take me into that level. I think that he's the perfect performer, for every girl to work with- - because he teaches you a lot about yourself while working with him. People started doing like the rough stuff, and the gonzo things, - and he kind of like threw himself in headfirst. Once the sex started, it just like seemed to go really naturally- - and it was easy to just like tell him like, - oh, I have no limits. You can do whatever you want. It was really cool. It was like a roller-coaster. - Oh, fuck, yes. Yes, yes. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the first time I had sex with Manuel, I was super nervous. I was shaking and he had to keep asking me if I was okay and if I could go through with this. I was like, yeah, you just don't understand you're a huge deal. Like when I was 18, I was watching you fuck other women. I'm gonna cum. I've done so many scenes with Manuel, it kind of blurs together. At the point, you know when you're gonna die, and your life flashes before your eyes? It would just be lots of dicks, but Manuel would be in there a lot. So I won AVN male performer of the year six times. Uh, one of them I think was, uh, foreign performer of the year. Like it's like basketball. Like everyone can play basketball. Not everyone's gonna be Kobe. We're talking about good sex down here. Rocco's up there, you know. Just like doing all sorts of crazy passionate, hard fucking. And my first movie with john was \"Buttman Ultimate Workout.\" John, you know what kind of girl I like. I like a girl with the big, round, culo ass. This is the most successful series I ever done. I mean, john for me has really been a mentor. I think every male performer has Rocco in some way as a role model. He just exudes sexuality, - and you can't put your finger on what that is, right? That's just a thing. That's a DNA thing. When Rocco came along, you realized, oh, I can get a phenomenal sex scene. He will make this girl look really, really good. He'll make her look better than in any other movie. Since I was very teeny, very young, I had this kind of fire inside. I remember I was 13, jerking off, jerking off, jerking off, and the doctor, I remember, - was very angry, told me, hey, man, stop the jerk off. Otherwise you never, you will never get better. His performance was 30 different than anything else. He never broke eye contact. Well, my first Boy/Girl scene was with the infamous Rocco Siffredi. I didn't know his type of scenes, how aggressive they are. Speaking to me in Italian. It was great 'cause he, he, he made love to me. You know, I did two movies in french, which was not porn, it was mainstream. It was an incredible experience. Catherine come back with the movie, for me as main star. A gay guy prostitute for the first time make love with a woman. One of the best experience in my life. Elegance, style, grace, sexuality, intensity. I love that guy. And when you fuck a woman, you put your soul. You don't fuck the girl just with the dick. Woman, you need to fuck them in the brain if you want to bring something out of them. Oh, my god. In many ways both positive and negative, - the adult industry mirrors mainstream entertainment. Like Hollywood, the adult film industry- - has been correctly criticized for its lack of diversity. Performers, directors, and producers of color have been too rare in times past. But today, performers of color are starting to break through more regularly- - and controlling their own careers both in front and behind the camera. These next trailblazers made that possible- - by working through the inherent prejudice in the sex business- - and forging successful and even legendary careers. Misty Stone, so she came across as like funny, interesting, vivacious, and cool. Like totally cool. And it's really cool to see a woman of color- - in the industry that's not your typical like 34DD with a gigantic big old booty. And she's like petite and sensual, and just on fire. I think I just fell into the adult films. After awhile, it became more of a career decision because I loved it so much, - I wanted to be the best at it. The \"Men In Black\" parody, that movie was amazing. The special effects, the makeup was outrageous. So many girls that do Girl/Girl, like not to spoil the party, are not into Girl/Girl. I was so nervous, because, you know, like she's, she's my mentor like. When you kind of get to work with one of your idols, - you're just like, I hope they're into it. By the time we were like five minutes into it, - once we're kissing and stuff, I felt so there with her. She was one of those girls that would like would flirt before the scene- - is in the makeup chair feeling on you. Just really immediately kind of pulling me in. But now in my personal life, I got to have some dick, baby. Oh, I'm gonna cum. Being a ebony model in the business, - you kind of have a sort of like a different journey in a way, - you know, because the opportunities are different. You kind of have to really know how to carry yourself- - and know how to present yourself to the right people, - and I feel like misty has done that from the very beginning. When I started, I was told to follow Misty Stone- - as a role model, and I'm glad that I have. It's not based on popularity. It's, it's, it's based on your skin tone, baby. Say a new girl coming into the industry, and she's very dark skinned. Well, then you also have another new girl coming in the industry, - and she's a little bit more lighter skinner. Well, guess what? That lighter skinned young Lady- - is gonna get a lot more work than the darker skinner young Lady, - and that's just how it is. Now, another example would be, well, we have this young white girl- - who's gonna get 1,500 for this scene, - but I think we're gonna give this young black young Lady- - 800 for the scene, and that's just how it is. Even our own black people do it to us, and that's even sadder. That they downgrade us when they should be uplifting us. She's a character. I've brought my little sister to a scene, and it was back in the day. It was my first gangbang I ever did in my whole life. I just needed support, - and I thought that that's what family's supposed to do was be there and support you. But I don't think they're supposed to be there and support you- - when you're getting gang-banged by six or seven guys. Vanessa being the first official Latin porn-star. Wow. She is a true pioneer. She is a trailblazing superwoman that I have just, I can identify with. You talk about staying power and star power, she's, I mean, - she might be one of the most, you know, the more iconic. And I guess that's also has to do with that Latin heat. Wild, wild fucking. Nice, nice, very nice woman. Cubans are wild. Mm... I guess I was, I was like the first woman of color in the business. They saw that there was a market for it because I became so popular so fast. She had a following from day one, and she was smart enough to realize it- - and she was one of the first women to get $1,000 a day, - which was unheard of at that point. Most of the women were working for 300, 350, in that neighborhood. Hey, wait a minute. He's your husband, and you've got five minutes to finish him off and go home. I have to go to work. I did waitress. I did go-go. I did stripping. I did hooking. I did the whole 42nd street stroll, which was fun. My first movie was \"China Doll.\" Vanessa Del Rio, the inventor of the DP. I'll take the title, but I'm sure that there was double penetration going on before me. Come on, baby. Stick it in. Come on. And I blew the cameraman. Ooh! In my first movie. That's what the '70s was like. I liked the seedy environment, and the way a peep show smelled, you know, - with the Clorox and cum. The live sex shows took place at show world. David Christopher, I think he had like a bunch of guys and girls, - like couples that wanted to see a couple fuck. Just, you know, being surrounded by a bunch of gawkers, you know, men and women. So if you wanna know why my clit was so big, was because I did body building, - and, yes, I did steroids. Doing the steroids and the side effects that's I don't recommend. But having a big clit from it, yeah. What woman wouldn't? I mean, it looks like a little dick. I suppose it is perverse, letting them believe I can't speak English and all. She would only get typecast as the, the maid. No matter how great she looked, how glamorous. Very early on, it was a white industry, - so here I come with my, you know, - bigger than life like, you know, big hair, and you know, like that. And so I was noted as first Latina. Pretty good, no? Vanessa Del Rio is an inspiration to girls like me in the industry- - that are of Latin descent, you know, because she didn't let that hold her back. She owned it. Oh, yess, yes, yes. Asa Akira is certainly a character like no other. 30 my first job in the adult entertainment world was as a dominatrix when I was 19 years old. I was just walking down the street one day, and this guy just stopped me on the street- - and asked me, would you be interested in being in the adult entertainment industry? And I was like, yes. And I followed him upstairs to his dungeon. The next day, I started training to be a dominatrix. So I'm really lucky. I mean, he could have killed me. That is her 100% of the time. She has no filter. She is the beginning of what I feel like what made, made this business step outside the box. In 2013, I signed an exclusive contract with Wicked Pictures. Probably the first girl I signed that already was a huge star. Wicked shoots really beautiful, high budget, like glamorous stuff. So the AVN awards were one of the few things- - I actually knew about porn coming in, so it was really exciting to be asked to host the event. That same night that I hosted the awards, I won Female Performer of The Year. All: Asa Akira. Oh, my god. Yes. I wanted this so fucking bad. I got this theory that the reasons there are never that many Asian girls - in the industry at any given time is 'cause for most of us, - like the second our family finds out, that's it. That's worked out to my advantage. Like I got to be in a lot of movies as the Asian girl. And I think that's very wrong. I think she is very much, whether she was Asian or not is an amazing performer. And she really is gonna be one of the last big stars of porn. Like I said, she would go to a shoot to do an anal shoot- - and end up doing a gangbang by accident. There was a lot of accidents on her sets, - but I guess happy accidents for the directors. You know, like I always tell people like I'm the best case scenario in porn. Found love. I've found a career. Um, I've never been taken advantage of. Last year I had a memoir published. Uh, it's titled \"insatiable: Porn a love story.\" And that's like exactly how I feel about the industry. It's, it's, it's been a love story. Um, as cheesy as that sounds. The modern adult star is a much different breed than those in the past. 25 years ago, tattoos and piercings were taboo. Sex acts performed in movies- - rarely included bondage, discipline, or S&M. Today, some of the biggest adult stars- - are what we might call alternative. But even as the alternative blends into mainstream, - these stars stand out with their unique styles- - and no fears, no limits approach... To sex. - You like my blazer? - Oh, yeah. She was going to make herself a brand, - and she wanted to shoot hot tattooed girls- - and alternative styles, which was very different from what you were typically seeing. Why I think Joanna is such a big star- - is because that she doesn't try to change her style- - where it's like, well, they're doing that, - so we should start doing that. It's like, - no, this is what works for us. And that's what her fans love. Joanna angel has always been a person- - who I've looked up to in the industry. Someone who started her own business when she was in college. I don't think it was me that actually came up with burning angel, - but I did say I wanted some kind of good girl, bad girl thing. I didn't know anything about porn. I had never watched a porn. I knew nothing about the industry. I didn't even really know that porn was an industry. I mean, this was 13 or 14 years ago. There was no Twitter, there was no Instagram. You could not just log on to anywhere on the internet- - and find out what porn-stars do every day. So I guess I was the first girl- - to have her own hardcore video porn site. So we got a lot of press when we first started. I wasn't expecting to be a figurehead, for punk and porn and feminism. I wanted to do everything, - so the first scene I ever did I had anal sex, - and that was only like the third time I even did it in my whole life. - here's what happens when a website becomes a movie. I don't know if anyone really got it. So Tommy pistol, it was his first scene and my first scene. He kept asking me if, if he would have to shave- - his ass or not if he did the movie. A lot of the sex that we had- - was like in places in new york or Brooklyn, - and sometimes they were out on rooftops- - or in like in school busses- - and with a lot of Hasidic Jews walking around- - wondering what's going on in there? Something I really love about Joanna- - is that she has a really great sense of humor. And so she always brings that piece of herself into her scenes. Thank you, kind sir. And I'll tell you what. I'll even let you put it in my butt. I've now won an AVN award, for best sex comedy three times now. It's kind of where I've sort of found my comfort zone in porn. She also picked up on it really early in her career that if she had her own site, - that she wanted her sites to be the only place you could find Joanna angel fucking. I really hate the term \"Alt Porn,\" - but I do realize that everything in porn needs a category. I got into porn by literally weaseling my way- - into the porn industry, and I'm still here. Pick up a camera, shoot something, - get it out there, you're in porn. There it is. Oh, god, I think I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum. Skin diamond is easily one of the greatest crossover, BDSM, and porn performers. I think that's probably why so many people like her- - is because she's not afraid to be herself. She's just as good at receiving flogging and nipple clamps as she is at taking anal. She's very exotic. Like she could be from the future. She could be from the past. She could be from Pangia. I don't know. Oh, yeah. Oh. I was born in California, - but I moved to Scotland when I was three because my dad was a missionary. I wanted to start modeling nude, - which was a big deal, - because at the time, my dad had transitioned- - from being a missionary to a children's tv show host. So it was a, a big scandal. I mean, ten or 20 years ago I don't think somebody could have like- - built their entire career being alternative looking, I would say. She understands being a sex worker in a way that a lot of the newer girls don't get. Not only that, but alternative sex worker by choice. Coming from the fetish scene, you know, it's, it's a very misunderstood group. And then all of a sudden, I was in this environment where the dirtier, the better. Like you wanna do something crazy? Then let's film it. I had her like kind of all tied up and was like- - filming her on like a super 8 camera and being really creepy. And like, I'm gonna be a star. You're my princess. She's the type of person that you want to fuck. With a gun. - No, I'm not lying. - Don't lie to me. No. When I first got in, everyone told me to, - that, again, that my look was too extreme. But it was actually, it actually worked in my favor, - I think, because it made me stand out. I, I think that being a submissive woman- - is a very empowering thing to do um, because you have to be- - really tough, and in the fetish world, it's all about consent. It's not about abuse. I've been very blessed in that I've gotten a lot of mainstream attention. I've actually got to do some really cool stuff. Count to ten. One. Two. Why are you being so gentle? Oh! I have a lot of nerdy pleasures, so I did a whole movie- - where I cos-played different characters from the different worlds. Wind moving through the leaves, bring me harry potter please. A few years ago, I was featured in a marvel comic, the new \"Daredevil\"- - as the reference model to draw echo. Pretty, pretty cool. I'm sorry. I gotta, I gotta hand it to myself. So against what a lot of the industry- - considers to be all odds, she's risen further- - than most people can ever dream of rising. By showing her true self, I think she's a, she's kind of, she's kind of my hero for that. I think it really goes to show how far we've come as human beings right now. Liking crazy sex isn't as unusual for a girl to like sucking cock. Are you not his whore? Both my parents were very religious in the Mormon religion, - so I kind of grew up with that upbringing. I transitioned from Jesus to the adult industry by seeking I think validation. It's refreshing to be around someone- - that is so comfortable with themselves and who they are- - that it makes you feel more comfortable with who you are. She wasn't a fake person in any way, shape or form. And I hate to say it, but in the porn business, - sometimes being somewhat fake with your emotions is a necessity. You think you can handle me? Yeah, I think so. I think I can handle you. I think you need to bend over. The thing that led to belladonna's popularity, - I believe, was when Diane sawyer profiled her on \"Prime Time Live.\" The hatchet job, but people had a lot of empathy for belladonna, - and that opened the door for her success. She says afterwards she was shattered, - but she just didn't know how to refuse. Because I didn't know any better, you know? I had these ideas of fame and attention and money. When she started, if a girl had a tattoo, - more than half the producers wouldn't even hire the person if they had tattoos. And by the time she finished, it was a completely different world. Ahe attention that I was getting from my body was powerful. You know, it was the first time in my life I felt like, wow, like I am sexy. I got an opportunity to direct for evil angel. As a female director who was really the one with the ideas. Because she could be real in those movies, - and she was in a safe, comfortable environment. We were just hanging out and capture what you capture, and that's it. You know, I had never really thought too much about what I was doing. I got these opportunities and I did 'em- - and I was very much in the moment, day to day. And in the height of DVD sales, belladonna was a top seller week after week. In the 1970s and early 1980s, when porn was mostly still shown in movie theaters, - acting was as much a premium as sexual ability. Some of the greatest actors from the golden age of adult cinema were classically trained. Appearing in adult films then became an act of rebellion. Here now are adult cinema's most award worthy dramatic performers. I am compelled to introduce myself. My name is Johnny Dooropener. Howdy, Mr. Dooropener. How did you know who I was? It's my business to know people. John was very innovative. He was the real deal all day. He actually could act, and then he could also do a, a sexual performance, and I think- - to be able to do both was just a pretty rare gift. Of all the male porn-stars in the '70s, he probably sold the most tickets. He was the only actor of that era- - that people came to see because of his acting, and his charisma, - and he was the Clark Gable of his era. At that time, there was no material out there, so they had- - soft-core movies, right, people had soft-core movies, - let's cut in hardcore footage. They'd cut from this film of this guy pretending to fuck this girl, soft-core, - and they'd cut in me fucking the girl, so you get a little in and out. I did five one day, inserts and cum shots. Every time you came, they gave you another fucking $50. And I don't know why they wanted the fourth and fifth one 'cause it was blanks. He just had a way about him that was '80s charismatic. I would say he's like the Clint Eastwood of porn. You just wanted to, to please him. He had swag and he was sexy, and he was, he was like a ladies man. And I feel like women wanted him, and men kind of wanted to be him. Did I give you enough dick? Huh? I give you enough dick? He was the original guy to talk dirty to girls to get where he wanted to get. I bet the police get in your pants all the time, huh? But you gotta watch those cops. They'll fuck you to death. - You ever been fucked in the ass before? - Mm-mm. - Are you curious what it's about? - Mm. It was, it was fun, it was mostly fun because we were best friends. The last two weeks he was alive, he was hanging at joey's, - and, uh, they just understood each other. Well, to be honest, I wish john was even more, - uh, had more of an impact than he was. That's a big problem with this business is that when you are gone in this business, you are gone. I mean, anybody that can do ten pages of script, four costume changes, - and three sex scenes in a ten-hour day, you know, goes to the top of the list. - Oh, yeah, fuck her. - No, I don't think I will. Oh, fuck her like you fuck me, Nick. Making films was a lot different then, and it was huge. Like we would have big red carpet premieres, and you would go into a theater. And if it was a good movie, you could run six weeks, two months, - playing the same movie at a theater. I thought, wow. I could act. All my friends from college weren't acting. I could get paid for it, and I could have sex. It was like, oh, yeah. You always carry around girl's underpants? Yeah, I collect them. Maybe I can give you some of mine sometime. Veronica came across as more intelligent. She came across as more capable, and her scenes came off as very genuine. One of the most favorite roles that I've ever had was in \"Amanda by Night.\" Can you fucking believe that? Oh, no, no. Another reason why I really liked that movie is I actually won best actress. Now if I could ask you a question. Why did your last coordinator leave? She wasn't putting out, uh, she wasn't putting out- - the kinds of results that we were looking for. Mm-hmm. You do have, uh, quite an employment history. \"Wanda Whips Wall Street.\" What a fun movie that was. They actually made a straight film out of it- - called \"Stocks and Blondes.\" We went back and re-shot. You know, Lester, I don't usually go out with men from the office, - but seeing as you're from Tyler's Cleveland branch, - I thought I'd make an exception. Veronica became the quintessential sex goddess, and the actress. And she was still managed to maintain the feeling- - that she was your girlfriend or the friend of your sister's. I did 13 movies one year, and they told me I had ruined my career. And what it did, it just made me more well known. People have a lot to say about this business, - but where else can a female do so many things? I mean, I've done about everything in the business. I was able to act, I was able to direct, - I could produce, I'd been a stylist, I'm still a production manager. Where else? I know the straight business wouldn't afford me that. In a career sense, good actress, sexy gal, somebody that you could, uh, - jerk off to and not feel bad about, - but made you feel good about being a sexual human being- And who really wanted to connect, and really wanted to spread love. Jamie was absolutely the icon of all time. And he's one of the pioneers of modern pornography, a complete and total deviant. Creepy, dirty, nasty, sexy behavior. He was able somehow to, to make it classy. Happened pretty quickly, because once I started working, - uh, it was like an avalanche after about a year, you know, maybe a year. It was like all of a sudden, I was the guy, you know, that, - I mean, there was one point in new york where I counted 14 of my films playing in one day. It's amazing to me that somebody who is famous in the end- - for showing the raw, real side of their sexuality is also an amazing actor. You know, you pulled off quite a neat little trick with that fantasy of yours. - Does that feel good? - Yeah, it's just sex. I am pretty dirty, though, girls. You'll have to work hard. Repent! You must repent! God! Please forgive me! To me, sex was a big drug, if you want to call it that. I was really interested in the sex. The idea that people were getting, drinking or taking pills to, to, you know, - forget the experience they were having on the set, you know, or maybe they felt bad about it. I don't know what they were doing. To me it didn't, it didn't make any sense to me. You know, I was really after the, the piece of ass I was gonna fuck. Men, women, I don't think it mattered to him. Jamie Gillis may have said at times that he was bisexual, - but I think the only label you could put on Jamie Gillis is pervert. Jamie, um, Gillis would not fly. I remember it was on a TWA flight, and we're gonna take off, - and Jamie tells me that he has a tremendous fear of flying. And then he reaches down, he pulls out a baggie- - that's got panties in it and he says, this is for my black, black ore. The plane starts rolling down the runway. Jamie opens up the bag, and he starts, he starts huffing on it, the bag, - and the smell from the bag was so horrendous and so putrid, it was insane. I mean, that was Jamie. He was a pervert, - so sniffing the panties, that was like crack cocaine to him. \"Dracula Sucks,\" that was the role he was meant to play. The blood is the life- - there are far worse things awaiting man than death. In my heyday, I was maybe working maybe one or two days a week. The rest of the time, I was just hanging out, - you know, and I was making enough money- - and I wasn't even, what was that? You call that work? You know, a garbage man, that's work. And to have a career that lasts that long, - to be so innovative, and to really express- - who you truly are as a sexual being to me is something to be envied. Annette definitely looked like she would be in the mainstream movies. She definitely did not look like she was in the adult industry. She could've been a Victoria secret model. She was just so fetching and a wonderful actress- - and serious as a heart attack and a great businesswoman. The most amazing thing for me about Annette haven- - is, um, not just like how beautiful she is, but also how kind of innocent she is. She combined like this very ethereal personality, look, and so forth with the sex. And, uh, she was one of the first where, - where her name became, you know, a name. I wasn't aware of how popular I was. I have never been aware of that. I've never been aware of how beautiful I am. I remember being in la. In the summer of '77, and \"desires within young girls\"- - making more money at the box office than over half of Hollywood. I was in slot 14. Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein\" was in slot 17. Annette, uh, was always perceived as a feminist, and she still is. As far as I know, I am the only person in adult films- - who did not do any of the degrading acts. The facial ejaculation, because I don't want- - that represented to the American public as adult sexuality. You know what's interesting about Annette is that- - you would almost kind of not expect her- - to be a very good actress just based off of the fact- - that she didn't have an acting background. But she is so good. You said you'd give me a chance. Aren't you forgetting something? \"Sports Life\" is a man's magazine. But that's just it, you see, - we get all the women's readership, too. Finding people who could speak, - who were beautiful, who had beautiful bodies, - blah, blah, blah, it was a bit difficult, I guess. Blake Edwards approached me for \"10.\" Blake was very nice, and invited me down to Hollywood. He said, can you get me people who are naked? And I said, oh, yeah. So I was the casting agent, and the production manager for the party scene. There was something, uh, just wonderful to watch- - Annette Haven on film having sex. We all have to pretend, what, our mommies didn't have sex. Every last one of our mommies had sex. Hopefully they enjoyed it. I want you to let me see your tits. How and when did I meet Richard Pacheco? I think it was some point in the early '80$. When he said that he was writing a book, he said, will you write the forward? And I said I would. He is family. He's a nice Jewish boy. You could take him home to mom I think. I had plans of becoming a rabbi, and they happened at the same time, - uh, I had my first offer to be in a porn film. So I had a decision to make. Richard's motivation was to be an actor, uh, much more than a, a sex performer. By far, Richard Pacheco is the greatest male actor in adult film history. Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow- - go straight to my lover's heart for me. When I met him, I was kind of freaked out- - because my mom and I enjoyed \"Playgirl\" magazine, and we had his pinup. In the 1980s, if Hollywood didn't put a scarlet letter- - around the adult industry, he would have been the first actor- - to cross over and actually do adult, and then do mainstream films, - like James Deen does now. Richard Pacheco won best supporting actor, for \"nothing to hide,\" uh, - because he portrayed somebody that was, uh, slow. But he was really sweet, too, and it was a very romantic little storyline. I love her. Well, I love Miss Fernstein the landlord, too. That doesn't mean I'm gonna marry her, does it? It's not the same thing, jack, and you know it. Fuck love, man! What are you, a sucker? \"Irresistible\" was “Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" They must have taken cues from that. There were so many different parallels with that. What province are you from? You probably haven't heard of it. It's called Marin county. They gave me Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. And, wow. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. That was a coup. It's ironic that porn-stars were discredited- - because they were fucking, 'cause you can't fake fucking. You really got to be there, and that's a tremendous achievement- - to get yourself real enough to be able to do that. Do I think he would've made it as a straight actor? Probably, you know, 'cause he's really good. He knows how to improvise. He knows how to be a straight actor. He knows these things. I think that's what makes him one of the greats. Some adult stars gain even greater fame- - by crossing over into mainstream entertainment. Sometimes a scandal worked in their favor. Other times, great marketing, or an inherently irresistible appeal- - bridged the gap between sex stardom, and pop culture acclaim. These stars blasted right through barriers- - separating the adult business from big time show business. Of those big three, Linda Lovelace, Georgina Spelvin, - Marilyn Chambers, Marilyn clearly stands out. The camera loved her. But she had this girl next door like innocent look- - that not many girls in porn back then had. Well, I answered an ad in the San Francisco \"Chronicle\"- - that said, now casting for a major motion picture. I thought, oh, this is a little bit too naughty for me. She thought that if she did a good job in this movie- - it would lead to a lot of mainstream roles for her- - because it would show that she could act. But also, the amount of money they were offering was like, mm. You know, they're like we really like your look. Just sit down and talk with us. And so she actually negotiated with them, and said that she would do it, - but only under the circumstances - that they give her, um, ten percent of the film's gross revenue, - which is huge, you know, like that's insane. And I said I don't really wanna know what's gonna happen. I know it's gonna be wild and sexy, - and it's gonna be scary probably for me at certain times, but I don't wanna know. When we started to have sex, it was the kind of thing where I was like totally freaked out. I didn't think I was gonna be able to do this one. Then it, there was a moment where it turned from terror, hah, to pleasure, - and I really believe you can see that. The controversy between me being on the ivory soap box, - it was a pr man's dream. It just happened to be the very same week that \"Behind the Green Door\" opened in the theaters. So it was just, thank you. And Procter & Gamble wasn't real happy about it. My favorite scene is the pool table scene in \"Insatiable.\" I could tell that it was a hot scene- - because when the crew applauds you, you know that it's good. \"Insatiable\" was one of those quintessential movies. Rich girl who is a model, and she just had this sexual appetite- - that nobody could satisfy. I devote myself to all men, and a lot of women. She wrote a song for it, - for the movie she did, \"Insatiable,\" and she actually sang it. It's the song that plays behind the titles. She did some modeling beyond that. She even did dinner theater in Las Vegas, for about a year. Believe it or not, the mayor of Las Vegas gave her the key to the city. I don't know what it used to be like to hire an adult actor in a mainstream type movie. I don't know if that was a big stigma that people had to get over. I assume it must have been. The biggest one I remember is when Marilyn Chambers was in Cronenberg's film. And he cast her as the lead in his movie \"Rabid.\" You gotta come quick. You gotta come quick and get me. And of course that had never happened before. This was the first time someone who had been a porn-star, - who was well known as a porn-star was cast in a major mainstream movie. Being Marilyn Chambers has always been kind of, - not a facade, because I've always believed that you have to be that person 24 hours a day. You have to really believe in what you're doing, which I have, and I've had a lot of fun. But now that I have a daughter. Learning all of that was kind of scary at first, because like I said, - my mom is my mom, not Marilyn chambers to me. So knowing everything that she's done- - and my friends knowing the things that she's done, - um, is was pretty hard to get used to. But there were some funny times where I'd see her name on HBO- - and she'd come running out and say like, close your eyes. Don't watch that. I just don't want her to follow in my footsteps. In the end like I'm just so proud of her, and she knew that, so that was my only concern. I'm not gonna say that I created porno chic, but I know that I was part of it. And that was a very important time in our history- - where people like Johnny Carson were waiting in line- - to see “Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door.\" And I truly believe that it's not educational, - but it certainly can be very helpful in kind of helping your sex life. It helped mine. He's not, you know, sort of like the hulking male porn-star. Of the '90s with like the, you know, like thong tan lines and stuff like huge pecs. And he's just this guy, the kind of guy that you would have a crush on in chemistry class. That's him. He's the Justin Bieber of porn. So my whole life is I wanna do porn, I wanna do porn, I wanna do porn. It wasn't a new thing when I turned 18 to, you know, tell my parents. So once I explained all this to my parents, - and then also reminded them that I still have my money- - from when I got bar mitzvahed. Like I, I'm not the type of guy who's gonna think, oh, I made a bunch of money. I'm gonna go buy a Ferrari and a solid gold house, and like get a rocket car. That's also a \"Simpson's\" reference. I met James when he was, I believe he was 18 years old. I mean, he was just good. I mean, we went through the entire scene, - and then he popped, and I was like, oh, shit. We've got to go through and do the stills. And he was like: \"That's cool. I'm young and spry. I can get some more out.\" So... and he did, which was outstanding. In 2009, I became the youngest person to ever win male performer of the year- - from AVN, which is a very prestigious award. All: James Deen. I had a panic attack, ran and hid, and my girlfriend at the time accepted the award for me. James, where the fuck are you? I have heard of the Deen-agers. Deen-agers is invented by Dana Dearmond. She was the one who coined that term, so let's give credit where credit is due. Because he's such a relatable guy, - and he's young enough for, you know, young girls to be attracted to him. What's funny to be me is there are scenes that I've done with him- - and I'll get tagged because he's in the scene, and the Deen-agers love James Deen, - and I just happened to be an extra body in the room. I feel like people are trying to create more of that \"Boy and Girl Next Door\" look. But when I first started in 2004, it was all about performance. It had nothing to do with guys or props. We don't care what you look like, you know. Like why the hell, who's looking at you? I have no desire to do mainstream stuff. \"The Canyons\"? Hell, yeah. You have Bret Easton Ellis, who's an incredibly talented writer- - and you have Paul Schrader who's an incredibly talented director- - and they were like so sick of the standard Hollywood structure of, you know, - all the stuff, and they wanted to do a DIY film- - that was just for the sake of making a fucking film. - Jealous? - Yeah, - if there are other people involved. Like guys. It's mostly girls, and, no, I do not get jealous watching my girl hook up with another chick. Is this guy for real? Are you for real? Which is the most flattering thing in the world- - that the guy that wrote \"American Psycho\" and \"Less Than Zero\"- - wrote a character for me. I mean, sometimes these, these, you know, people in adult will get like this sort of taste- - of mainstream attention and decide that they're, they're gonna move on and start this whole new life. Adult films are not a launching pad into mainstream. It's just not. I think there's this stigma that people in adult films, - they do this 'cause they have to- - or they do this because they have nothing else- - or, or, and they forget that we're performers, - just like The Rock and Vin Diesel are action performers. Being famous in the adult industry is useless. Being a good performer is what matters. She was Vivid. They signed her to be the face of the company. She was on every box cover. Well, there was no such thing as a contract girl until Ginger came along. She is definitely a matriarch in the business. I think she's the beautiful girl next door. I do. I think she's that girl next door- - that you've had that crush on for a really long time- - and then all of a sudden just kind of came into her own sexually. And you definitely wanted to bang the shit out of her, and she never had time for you. I walked into, uh, Jim South's office. He was my agent. Uh, you don't have a portfolio? Oh, no. I had my shots in high school. And I tell him, okay, I'm gonna do it. And I want this much money and I want script approval- - and I want cast approval. He's on the floor rolling. He said you're not gonna start that way. Lunch is served. I got all my demands met, and I started thinking, - oh, my god. What if I can't do this? My very first film was \"Surrender in Paradise.\" I was fine fucking on film. Could not get the dialogue to come out of my mouth. We spent about four hours trying to do it. And I thought you might be different. Like all the other guys, get what you want and chuck me out. So Steven Hirsch was starting vivid entertainment, - actually at that time, it was called vivid video, - and they wanted me to be the star of all of their first films. Every day I would wake up and go, yes! I'm gonna blow this guy today. I'm gonna eat that pussy today. I'm gonna do this. And it was exciting for me. If you stuck with it, if you became a pro, - hell, I don't think there's anybody that could even come close to you. Do I look okay? You look great. \"New Wave Hookers\" was an amazing film. Stick your tongue in up my ass hole and lick it. Girls next door didn't do double penetration. I was, I was the girl next door who did all the dirty things. I've done more mainstream than I have adult at this point. I need to pee! - What about my hands? - What about 'em? - How am I gonna wipe? - I'll help ya. So I did \"Vice Academy\" one, two, and three. And each of you must make ten arrests in order to get a position on the force. My father says that my badge and uniform are already waiting for me. So I like hiring people where they already- - come with their weird baggage of their career or life. So as soon as they walk on screen, you know, be it a Ginger Lynn or a Danny Trejo, - you go, somethin's goin' on there. She showed up on crutches, which was kind of a surprise. My introduction to Sid Haig was just being plopped on on his dirty tighty whities. - Yes, yes, yes. - Come on, baby. Oh, oh, oh, ride it, baby. Ride it, ride it, ride it. She started it all. I mean, without her, there could not have been - strong names like Chasey Lain, and Jenna Jameson. She is the number one. There are very few women like her. Do it! Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, slam it. Slam that cunt for me. Ugh! Yeah! I felt like I could watch her, and see the emotion- - not just in her face, but in her body. Janine is super hot. Like super hot, like supermodel hot. I asked my husband if he was okay with it, and we agreed that women only. She knew how to turn it on. She'd been in front of audiences- - for a long time as a dancer. In blondage, they did their routine, it was so hot, like I was completely turned on. And then they go backstage, and then they do their real scene- - in the behind the scenes, and I was like, yeah, yeah. The drugs, the alcohol involved with porn. During that time, there was, and I would partake, and it was not a pretty sight. You will sink hard and fast if you go down that road. She is the person that made porn feel not only super mainstream, - but she was kind of like the rockstar of porn. Blink 182. That has got to be my highlight. It brought in the youth. So the Vince Neil sex tape. It was rough, because at this time, I hadn't shot anything with men. But, you know, it was a shocker at first. I find it interesting that she comes back- - as like this like beast of a sexual woman. She does dudes. She does interracial. Please? Please please me. Finally I said fuck it. I'm gonna go for it, and this is what I want. These are my fantasies. And that's when I think a lot of like the passionate scenes that I had in \"Pirates,\" you know... Um, that intensity was really starting to come out. I wouldn't change a thing. At the time, there was a lot of glamour and a lot of fun, and a lot of camaraderie. That was, that was a good time. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, my god. Fuck. Yes, yes. I'd like to think I was political before, and that was- - a large part of my motivation getting into the industry- - was to disprove the status quo about women, uh, and, and, and female sexuality. The more I watched porn, the more I realized that this is something I could do- - and, and maybe I could bring something different to it as well. When Sasha Grey first contacted me, this is what she wrote me. \"I hunger for all modes of sexual perversity.\" I'm determined and ready to be a commodity that fulfills everyone's fantasies. Available for solo, stills, girl/girl, boy/girl, boy/boy/girl, - DP, double vag, interracial, throat gagging, - creampies, BDSM, fetish, facials, \"bachelor parties, and groups of no more than four.\" She's cool. Sasha is, is deep. We're remaking \"Deep Throat,\" so I want to meet her. The new \"Deep Throat\" is a huge movie. It's important. It's the biggest movie, you know, this company has ever made. It took us a long time to decide who could really pull it off, and it's Sasha. Steven Soderbergh looked her up, and found the Myspace page. Contacted her through that. I didn't want anybody other than Sasha, for \"Girlfriend Experience.\" Once I'd spoken to her, - I really felt I wanted to build it around her, - and I sort of cast everybody else based on what I was getting from her. I'm very familiar with his work, and it was flattering, to be honest, - uh, but also extremely intimidating. He's an incredibly intelligent human being. I found this, it's kind of a really interesting dichotomy with her of, of- - middle American upbringing, and sort of extreme interest and extreme behavior. Whatever method she found of reconciling these two things, - seemed to be working for her. He told me it would be mostly improv, and wanted me to be comfortable with that. So how did it go? It was fine. We had a nice dinner. You know, went back to the hotel. But he's very well-endowed, and sometimes I just can't handle him that long. The change, I think, largely via the internet about people's attitudes about pornography - or just, just sex videos in general has just completely shifted in the last ten years. Making that leap from doing hardcore porn to shooting mainstream movies - with very well known people is, is almost impossible. She was like Garbo-esque. So I said, well, if this is any time to take the jump, this is it, and I did it quietly. It wasn't this big announcement. I'm not leaving anything behind. I haven't found Jesus. I'm not trying to run away from anything. I'm just moving on. What made her a great porn-star? Besides the fact that she was really good looking, she was a pervert, - and nobody could bullshit her, because she was like usually smarter- - than most of the people shooting her. Some names are bigger than others. And the top two greatest adult stars of all time share one thing in common, - they're erotic icons. They check every box for what makes a legend. Longevity? Check. Mainstream popularity? Double check. Sexual prowess? Check. Looks? Well, women of the '70s and '80s found him very handsome, - and men still drool over her. There are no two bigger names in the history of adult cinema - than our greatest male and female adult stars of all time. ♪ You're a winner ♪“ ♪ That's what you are ♪ ♪ Believe it or not ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ You're really a star ♪ ♪ And so happy... ♪ Let's talk about fame. Uh, most famous guy in porn worldwide has gotta be Ron Jeremy. Without ever having had a publicist, without every having had an agent or a manager, - has managed to become the most famous pop culture icon. I mean, he transcends porn. People don't think of Ron Jeremy as a porn-star. People think of Ron Jeremy as a famous person. I was there in the golden era, - that's what they call it, the golden era, I was there right smack in the middle of it. I was going back and forth, L.A. to New York. I heard that his dick was so big that he actually could like, you know, go on himself. Go suck yourself off, she says. Charming. I first got into porn thinking I'd just be in it- - for maybe just a couple of weeks, a few months. See what it's like and then get out. So I started doing all the bigger films in New York. \"Bad Girls\" had a cute little story where I was a boy scout. Hello. Oh, my goodness! - Please. - What do you want? I'd like some of that pussy, if you don't mind. So he's infiltrated media in like all its forms, mainstream and porn. And he's fantastic. He's a really good actor. He's like the essential ham. As an actor, when he's awake, great performance. Adam Rifkin is the nicest guy I know- - and the greatest guy I know, and I have to say this- - or he'll stop giving me parts in movies, - the guy is easy and he's been more loyal than anybody on the planet. I made this movie called \"Detroit Rock City,\" and obviously to play the emcee- - at the male strip club was an easy one. That was our viking, Patrick Hirsch, - and he's hung like a Norse. Our next amateur has a name like a bird, and if you like birds, you'll like this. It's just a swallow. I'd never heard of him before I got in the industry. I saw him on MTV, uh, when he was doing a reality tv show. And that's the impression I had of him, not as a sexpert, just him being funny. I have a feeling there're gonna be a lot of people who are dead set against- - what I do for a living, maybe religious, could be born again, you know. So I have a gut feeling that I'm gonna come across- - some adversarial opinions as to my career choices. In \"Orgazmo,\" we do a martial art fight. At the end, he gets the Orgazmo's gun on me, - and I freeze up, kicks me in the head, my head literally blows up. \"Boon Dock Saints\" is by far the biggest thing I've ever done as far as an audience. Sit the fuck down. All these stars, when they see Ron Jeremy, - they drop whatever they do, I've seen it, drop whatever they do. Oh, my god. Get a picture with Ron Jeremy. Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love- - went running over to him for an autograph when they saw him. George Bush, Sr. was walking the other way having, - he was just President of The United States, - as they're passing, he hears George bush say, hello, Ron. That's why I attribute my longevity to just a lot of hard work, - a lot of classical movies from the golden era, - and also a lot of mainstream. It's amazing for all the things- - that Ron Jeremy has seen and done in his life, - how he manages to maintain a sense of innocence. And I swear to you, he is a, he's like an innocent kid- - in the body of this... Hideous monster. Listen, I'm gonna say goodbye now while I kiss these nipples. Look how and they're cold, they stick out even more. Why is Jenna so popular? She was maybe not even arguably- - the most successful, the most well marketed, - the best selling porn-star of all time. Jenna might've had a little bit of that Ginger Lynn thing- - where she just looked so young and sweet and innocent- - and looked like the last place she should be- - was looking to get into this business. And I thought I could do it better, you know. I just always felt that way all my life, that I was capable of topping everyone. That's the shot you'd see in your magazine, folks, right there. Yeah. Yeah. I read Jenna Jameson's book \"How to make love like a porn-star,\" - and I, I was so attracted to the industry from those pages. Jenna and I shot our first movie on the same day. - I'm Kylie. - And I'm Jenna. I'm 19. 'Cause, I mean, here's little Jenna, and she's a little blonde, perfect little tiny boobs, - and she was asking me about mine. She's like, where'd you get yours? They're great. What doctor did them? I'm like don't touch those. Those are perfect. Look, back in '95, - while the business was starting to go through a growth, - it was still only two years into Wicked Pictures. I just said, listen, you can either jump on the Jenna train- - or I'm out, and this is what I want. Give it to me and I will skyrocket. We signed Jenna, - and it didn't take very long for Jenna to become the big deal. Even then, you knew that Jenna was gonna be something big. She'd already started to climb that ladder, - and she was already Jenna vs. Jenna Jameson. I just had larger than life ideas. Jenna was winning Best Actress, Best Sex Scene, Starlet of the Year. One of her movies we did won Best Film. So it was really a quick ride. I was starting to gain momentum. I knew I was capable of so much more. She was everywhere. Again, she was not just on the porn sets. She was in movies. You have to be a stripper with a take no prisoners raw survival instinct. She was on talk shows. I can't believe it. I'm looking at your pictures. You could be a model. Thank you. By this time, she already knew what was going on. She knew how to light things and she knew how to direct- - and she knew the kind of scenes that she wanted to do. She owned all that. This ls a male dominated industry, and I can crack it open. I started my own company, club Jenna. I think Jenna Jameson was super business savvy, - and she, you know, had a whole idea of how her career was gonna go- - and exactly the moves she was going to make in order for her to have longevity in adult- - and also to make tons and tons of money at a time in the business, when, you know, it was opportune. I shot my own movies for my company, - and I also did a licensing! Distribution deal with Vivid, - which was ground breaking, like changed things for the whole industry when they saw those numbers. Then I got to direct her in, in uh, \"The Masseuse,\" of course, - and \"Devil in Miss Jones,\" - and two of the best movies I've ever done. Well, things are about to change. You can have anything you want. Oh... She became somewhat of a control freak. I felt myself like ramping up. I was like, okay, I'm starting to get this. She got so much adulation so quickly. I couldn't go anywhere without people screaming my name. And she didn't handle it as well as she might have. It was, it kind of blew my mind. I saw her become a caricature of herself. It was like being Julia Roberts when she got her Oscar, you know. She seemed to start to become less happy. I played the part. I worked it. I brought glamour. I never did anything half-ass. I think it was the right girl, the right time, - the right company, and all things were aligned, and it worked. Do I think it's possible to do that again on that level? I don't. I think she is probably the biggest star of all time- - because I don't think that can happen again. It's fair to say this list is far from complete. Dozens of other larger than life legends- - deserve to have their stories told, - performers who've contributed to the adult industry- - in unique and important ways, many of whom continue to. But when it comes to the modern porn industry, - which began in actual movie theaters five decades ago- - and continues on hand-held devices today, - these are the stars who have shined the brightest, and rocked us the hardest. I'm Mr. Skin. Good night. Woman excellent. I'm the best clapper ever. Nice. I have spent quite a bit of time with ginger. She will never cease to chase me around- - with a dildo or a strap-on or taking off my clothes, - and that's, that's ginger. I hated those scarves. The scarves were provided. There's enough cum on those scarves to start a whole new population of people. Something that I've never revealed about myself. I have a big giant penis. It's just, it's tucked inside my vagina. That's what I was gonna tell you. Is it good? Come on. I mean, you know, DP? That's kind of a natural thing. If there's another guy in the picture, you know, you got the extra hole. And she was a wild girl. Cubans are wild. Don't you know Cubans? They got that nice round ass and they're wild, man. My famous line was, you know, You wanna twat sandwich, baby? Where she had the biggest clit and the largest pussy lips- - at that particular time, which, I'm a freak, and so that immediately- - got me fanatically involved with like sucking and swallowing them down. I had a pimp, which he got paid 40%. I took 60 'cause I had to get a boyfriend out of jail. So I'm used to those days. Hippie girls, hair under their arms, - all that kind of stuff. Hair all over their legs. You couldn't see the pussy. It was all like a tree. You had to like take a rake and like rake it out to get even to see anything. And each scene was connected, not separate scenes. Everything flowed like a river or something. - And a lot of pubic hairs. - They were all so hairy. Pubic hair. There was a lot of hair. And she had pubic hair. And lots of it. I was just gonna say that. The first time I had a strange dick in my hairy pussy. It was the '80s. I'd probably been in the business a few months. I still was a little nervous about the business, - and now they have me driving out to the hinterlands, for this shoot, and I'm sure - that I'm gonna get killed out there, and buried in an avocado grove. Whoa. Sorry. That was so compelling, you lost your balance. I was impressed by both the ladies in that scene, actually. I saw that about to happen. There's a whole bunch of producers I had to sleep with to get a lot of jobs. No, I'm just... - I hope not. - Slept with two of 'em at least. And one that took you to a Barry Manilow concert. She called me up... Dude, but they made me stars, though. I slept with the right producers, I swear. Which ones off the record? I guess \"Deep Throat\" was such a big event. People were going to see \"Deep Throat.\" It wasn't a very good movie, but people wanted to see it. I guess part of it was Linda had, you know, had kind of a sweet look to her. She was a filthy little whore, but she had a sweet look to her. I really just love the whole idea that she has with the whole thing. I just went blah, blah, blah in my head. And I'm like blah, blah, blah. My first blow-job, and I'm looking everybody in the eye, - 'cause there's like 30 people on the set. Welcome to my blow-job. Welcome to my blow-job. Is this cool? I did ten films with Veronica Hart. And then we were talking about our parents, - and my father worked out at the test site out in Nevada. What a nice thing, your father makes bombs. How nice. I came down hard on her. I said your father's a murderer. All of a sudden, R. Bolla was saying- - that my dad was the cause of everything wrong in the world. I saw that she was hurt, so I told her I was sorry. I really did. I said I'm really sorry that I hate your father. No. Well done. I know who I fucked and when I fucked 'em. No, I burped. I burped. Here's a little tidbit about Ron. And Ron is desperate to be in mainstream movies. And I think to his detriment he has become, through his own doing, - too famous to be taken seriously as an actor the way he would like to be. So you just see Ron Jeremy you go, oh, it's Ron Jeremy. You don't see Ron Jeremy playing like the office guy- - or Ron Jeremy playing the attorney. It's like Ron Jeremy playing the attorney. The only way to actually to be the king of porn is like to, uh, kill Ron Jeremy. Just smack it. Excellent. Actually, I would like to do that again.

Whilst some mutants do like the idea of a cure, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn't be a cure. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his cure. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn't have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto. The Phoenix has woken within her, which has the ability to destroy anything in her way, even if that 'anything' is a X-Men.", "content": "I still don't know why l'm here. Couldn't you just make them say yes? Yes, I could, but it's not my way. And I would expect you, of all people, would understand my feelings about the misuse of power. Ah, \"power corrupts\" and all that. Yes, I know, Charles. When are you going to stop lecturing me? When you start listening. And you're here because I need you. We're not gonna have to meet every one ofthem in person, are we? No. This one's special. What a beautiful campus. John, don't you think? Yes, the brochure is great. But what aboutJean? What about her... illness? - Illness? -John. You thinkyour daughter is sick, Mr. Grey? Perhaps it would be best if we were to speak to her, alone. Ofcourse. Jean? Can you come down, dear? We'll, uh, leave you then. It's very rude, you know, to read my thoughts or Mr. Lehnsherr's... without our permission. Did you think you were the only one ofyour kind, young lady? We're mutants,Jean. We are like you. Really? I doubt that. Oh, Charles. I like this one. You have more power than you can imagine,Jean. The question is, will you control that power... or let it control you? Warren? Son, is everything all right? - What's going on in there? - Nothing! I'll be right out. Come on. You've been in there for over an hour. Open the door. Warren? One second! Open this door! Warren? Let me in there right now! Open the door! Oh, God. Not you. Dad, I'm sorry. The whole world's goin' to hell, you'rejust gonna sit there? Let's go. Bobby! Thanks, Kitty. - We're getting killed out here. - Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm. - Logan. - Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch. That was my last cigar. Logan! lt's getting closer! - Come on! Let's keep moving! - Hey, Tin Man! Come here! - How's your throwing arm? - Logan, we work as a team. Yeah, good luck with that. Throw me. Now! Damn it, Logan! Don't do this! Class dismissed. Hey, Colossus, nice throw. Simulation complete. What the hell was that? Danger Room session. You know what I mean. Oh, lighten up, Storm. Look, you can'tjust change the rules when you feel like it. I'm tryin' to teach 'em something. I taught 'em something. It was a defensive exercise. Yeah. Best defense is a good offense. Or is it the other way around? This isn't a game, Logan. Well, you sure fooled me. Hey, I'm just a sub. You got a problem, talk to Scott. - Scott! -Jean. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. Are you okay? I'm fine. Well, you don't seem fine. You seem like you're avoiding me. I mean, something's wrong. What's wrong is I can't touch my boyfriend without killin' him. Other than that, I'm wonderful. Hey. I don't think that's fair. Have I ever put any pressure on you? You're a guy, Bobby. Your mind's only on one thing. Hey, Scott, they were lookin' foryou downstairs. You didn't show. What do you care? Well, for starters, I had to coveryour ass. I didn't askyou to. No, you didn't. The professor did. I wasjust passing through. So pass through, Logan. Hey, look. I know howyou feel. Don't. When Jean died― I said don't. Maybe it's time for us to move on. Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan. Mr. Secretary? Yes. - The meeting's begun, sir. - Thankyou. Mr. President. Have a seat, Hank. Homeland Security was tracking Magneto. We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal. NAVSAT lost him crossing the border. But we did get a consolation prize. We picked her up breaking into the F.D.A., ofall places. Do you know who she's been imitating? Secretary Trask here. Yes, sir. She can do that. Not anymore, she can't. We got her. You thinkyour prisons can hold her? We have some new prisons, Hank. We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead this time. Where is Magneto? Raven? Raven, I asked you a question. I don't answer to my slave name. Raven Darkholme. That's your real name, isn't it? Or has he convinced you you don't have a family anymore? My family tried to kill me, you pathetic meat sack. Okay, then. Mystique. Where is he? In here with us. I don't want to play games with you. I want answers. You don't want to play games with me? You are gonna stop this. Tell me, where is Magneto? You want to know where he is? Homo sapien! You know her capture will only provoke Magneto. But having her does give us some diplomatic leverage. On principle, I can't negotiate with these people. I thought that's why you appointed me, sir. Yes, it is. But that's not why you called me here. No. This is. It's what she stole from the F.D.A. Dear Lord. Is it viable? We believe it is. You realize the level of impact this will have on the mutant community? Yes, I do. That's precisely why we need some ofyour... diplomacy now. When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything. Will it be for the greater good? Or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends? Now, this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because we are mutants. For psychics, this presents a particular problem. When is it acceptable to use our power, and when do we cross that invisible line... that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man? But Einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern... without any superhuman authority behind it. Einstein wasn't a mutant... so far as we know. Now, this case study was sent to me by a colleague, Dr. Moira MacTaggert.Jones? The man you see here was born with no higher-level brain functions. His organs and nervous system work, but he has no consciousness to speak of. Now, what ifwe were to transfer the consciousness ofone person, say a father offour with terminal cancer, into the body ofthis man? How are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what― Professor? We'll continue this tomorrow. Class dismissed. The forecast was for sunny skies. Oh. I'm sorry. I don't have to be psychic to see that something's bothering you. l don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive. We have a mutant in the cabinet, a president who understands us. Why are we still hiding? We're not hiding. But we still have enemies out there. And I must protect my students. You know that. Yes, but we can't be students forever. Storm, I hadn't thought ofyou as my student foryears. In fact, I thought that, perhaps, you might take my place some day. But Scott's— Scott's a changed man. He tookJean's death so hard. Yes, things are better out there. But you, ofall people, know how fast the weather can change. There's something you're not tellin' us. Hank? Ororo! Charles. Oh! I love what you've done with your hair. Mmm. You too. Thanks. Thankyou for seeing me on such short notice. Henry, you are always welcome here. You're a part ofthis place. - I have news. - Is it Eric? No. Though we have been making some progress on that front. - Mystique was recently apprehended. - Who's the furball? Hank McCoy, Secretary of Mutant Affairs. Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit. - Henry, this is Logan. He's, uh― - Wolverine. - I hearyou're quite an animal. - Look who's talkin'. You know Magneto's gonna come get Mystique, right? Magneto's not the problem. At least not our most pressing one. A major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody— - a way to suppress the mutant \"X\" gene. - Suppress? Permanently. They're calling it a cure. Well, that's ridiculous. You can't cure being a mutant. Well, scientifically speaking― Since when did we become a disease? How can anybody in their right― Storm. They're announcing it now. These so-called mutants are peoplejust like us. Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity. But I stand here today to tell you there's hope. And this site, once the world's most famous prison, will now be the source offreedom for all mutants who choose it. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present... the answer to mutation. Finally, we have a cure. Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind ofcoward would take itjust to fit in? Is it cowardice to save oneselffrom persecution? Not all of us can fit in so easily. You don't shed on the furniture. Well, for all we know, the government helped cook this up. - I can assure you the government had nothing to do with this. - Well, I've heard that before. My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws. Did hejust call me \"boy\"? Is it true? They can cure us? Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true. No, Professor. They can't cure us. You want to know why? Because there's nothin' to cure. Nothing's wrong with you. Or any of us, for that matter. How should we, as mutants, respond? Here's what I think. This is about getting organized, bringing our complaints to the right people. We need to put together a committee and talk to the government. They don't understand. They don't know what it means to be a mutant. We need to show them, educate them, let them know that we're here to stay. Come on. People, you must listen. - They won't take us seriously. - They want to exterminate us. This cure is voluntary. Nobody's talking about extermination. No one ever talks about it. Theyjust do it. And you go on with your lives, ignoring the signs all around you. And then, one day, when the air is still and the night has fallen, - they come foryou. - Excuse me, but-- It's only then you realize, while you were talking about organizing and committees, the extermination has already begun. Make no mistake, my brothers. They will draw first blood. They will force their cure upon us. The only question is, will you join my brotherhood and fight... or wait for the inevitable genocide? Who will you stand with― the humans... or us? You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape. Back off. Ifyou're so proud of being a mutant, where's your mark? I have been marked once, my dear, and let me assure you... no needle shall ever touch my skin again. You know who you're talkin' to? Do you? And what can you do? Hmm. So, you have talents. That and more. I know you control metal. And I know there's 87 mutants in here and none ofthem above a class three, other than you two. You can sense other mutants and their powers? Mm-hmm. Could you locate one for me? Let me out of here! l demand that you release me! Do you know who l am? I'm the president ofthe United States. Oh, Mr. President. Shut up! Why are you doing this to me? Let me down. l'll be a good girl. Please, let me go. Please? Keep it up. I'll sprayyou in the face, bitch. When I get out of here, I'm gonna kill you myself. Yeah, right. Secretary McCoy, welcome to Worthington Labs. Thankyou, Dr. Rao. Not an easy place to get to. It's the safest location we could find. That's why we keep the source ofthe cure here. He is a mutant. You understand our concern. We are in full compliance with your department's policy. How long will you keep the boy here? Until we can fully map his D.N.A. We can replicate it, but we can't generate it. And his power, what is its range? You'll see. Jimmy? There's someone I would like you to meet. Hello there, son. - Hi. - My name is Hank McCoy. I'm sorry. It's okay. You have an amazing gift. Thankyou,Jimmy. Extraordinary, isn't he? Yes, he is. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott. Scott. Stop. I'm here, Scott! Stop it. Scott. Scott. Scott! Stop it. - Scott! Scott! - Stop! Jean? Scott? How? I don't know. I want to see your eyes. Take these off. No. No. Trust me. I can control it now. Open them. You can't hurt me. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. What happened? No clue! Professor, you okay? Get to Alkali Lake. You don't want to be here. Do you? I can't see a damn thing. I can take care ofthat. What the― Logan! Oh, God. She's alive. Jean? The sheer mass ofwater that collapsed on top ofJean should have obliterated her completely. The only explanation ofJean's survival is that her powers... wrapped her in a cocoon oftelekinetic energy. Is she gonna be okay? Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've ever encountered, her potential practically limitless. Her mutation is seated in the unconscious part ofher mind, and therein lay the danger. When she was a girl, I created a series of psychic barriers... to isolate her powers from her conscious mind. And, as a result, Jean developed a dual personality. What? The consciousJean, whose powers were always in her control... and the dormant side, a personality that, in our sessions, came to call itself the Phoenix― a purely instinctual creature, all desire and joy... and rage. She knew all this? It's unclear how much she knew. Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is theJean Grey we know... or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free. She looks pretty peaceful to me. Because I'm keeping her that way. I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again. What have you done to her? Logan, you have to understand― - You're talkin' about a person's mind here, aboutJean. - She has to be controlled. Control? You know, sometimes when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry. You have no idea. You have no idea ofwhat she's capable. No, Professor. l had no idea what you were capable of. I had a terrible choice to make. I chose the lesser oftwo evils. Well, it sounds to me likeJean had no choice at all. I don't have to explain myself, least ofall to you. History will be made here today. For the first time, the so-called \"mutant cure\" will be available to the public. Now, reaction has run the gamut, with mutants on both sides ofthe line. Some are desperate for this cure, while others are offended by the very idea of it. Is Secretary McCoy going to be a problem? Hard to say. His political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues. Excuse me, sir? Your son's arrived. Good. Bring him in. You sure you want to start with him? I think it's important, yes. - Hello, Warren. - How are you, Son? You sleep well? Yeah. You know, I'm proud ofyou for doing this. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. Yeah. You ready? The transformation can be a littlejarring. Dad, can we talk about this for a sec? We've talked about it, Son. It'll all be over soon. Everything's going to be fine. Wait. - I can't do this. - Warren, calm down. - No. I-I can't do this. - Yes, you can. - Okay,just give me a minute― -Just relax, Son. Take it easy. - No! I can't do this! - Calm down. I promise you, it will be fine! Dad! Warren, relax! Warren, it's a better life. It's what we all want. No. It's what you want. Warren! No! Told you so. - About time. - I've been busy. Did you find what you were looking for? The source ofthe cure is a mutant, a child at Worthington Labs. Without him, they have nothing. Read offthe guest list. Cell 41 205. James Madrox. This one robbed seven banks... - at the same time. - I could use a man ofyour talents. I'm in. Welcome to the Brotherhood. Careful with this one. Cain Marko. Solitary confinement. Now, check this out. \"Prisoner must be confined at all times. - lfhe builds any momentum, no object can stop him.\" - How fascinating. - And what do they call you? -Juggernaut. - I can't imagine why. - You gonna let me out of here? I need to pee. - Nice helmet. - Keeps my face pretty. - I think he'll make a fine addition to our army. - Yeah. No! You saved me. Eric? I'm sorry, my dear. You're not one of us anymore. Such a shame. She was so beautiful. You think resigning's gonna make a difference? That's no way to influence policy. Policy is being made without me, Mr. President. The decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me. What happened on that convoy was inexcusable. But your actions― Hank, that was an isolated incident. You have to understand. Those mutants were a real threat. Have you even begun to think what a slippery slope you're on? I have. And I worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind. As do I. You and I know that it's only going to get worse. All the more reason why I need to be where I belong. Jean. - Hey, Logan. - Welcome back. Back where we first met. Only I was in your place and you were in mine. You okay? Yeah. More than okay. Logan, you're making me blush. - Are you reading my thoughts? - I don't have to. It's okay. - Wait. - No. Jean, this isn't you. Yes. Yes, it is me. No. Maybe you ought to take it easy, huh? The professor said you might be... different. He would know, wouldn't he? What? You think he's not in your head too? Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you. Where's Scott? Jean? Where am I? You're in the mansion. You need to tell me what happened to Scott. Jean, tell me what happened to him. Oh, God. Look at me. Jean, stay with me. Talk to me. Look at me. Look at me! No. Focus! Focus,Jean! Kill me. What? Kill me before I kill someone else. Don't say that. Please. Stop it. Kill me. Stop it. Look at me. Look at me.Jean. It'll be all right. We can help you. Okay? The professor can help. He can fix it. I don't want to fix it! Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun. I told you they would draw first blood. - So what do we do? - What do we do? We use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause. Come. We have an army to build. I picked something up. An electromagnetic force. It's massive. It's... a mutant. Class five. More powerful than anything I've ever felt. More powerful than you. Where is she? Logan? Jean?Jean! What happened? What have you done? - I think she killed Scott. - What? - That's not possible. - I warned you. She's left the mansion, but she's trying to block my thoughts. She's so strong. It may be too late. Wait for me here. What? I need to seeJean alone. You were right, Charles. This one is special. What the hell are you doing here? The same as the professor. Visiting an old friend. I don't want trouble here. Nor do I, Charles. So, shall we go inside? I came to bringJean home. Don't interfere, Eric. Just like old times, huh? She needs help. Jean is not well. Funny. You sound just like her parents. Nobody gets inside. I knewyou'd come. Ofcourse. I've come to bring you home. I have no home. Yes, you do. You have a home and a family. - He thinks your power is too great foryou to control. - Eric. I don't believe your mind games are going to work anymore, Charles. So you want to control me? No. He does. No. I want to help you. Help me? What's wrong with me? - Absolutely nothing. - Eric, stop! No, Charles! Not this time! You've always held her back! Foryour own good,Jean. Stay out of my head. I'm goin' in. The professor said he'd handle this. Look at me,Jean. I can help you. Look at me! No. Get out of my head. - Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles. - You must trust me. You're a danger to everyone and yourself! But I can help you! - I thinkyou want to give her the cure! - Look what happened to Scott! You killed the man you love because you couldn't control your power! No! Stop it! That's it. Jean, let me in. No,Jean! Jean! Don't let it control you. Charles! My dear, come with me. Oh, God! No. We live in an age ofdarkness, a world full offear, hate and intolerance. But in every age, there are those who fight against it. Charles Xavierwas born into a world divided, a world he tried to heal― a mission he never saw accomplished. It seems the destiny of great men to see their goals unfulfilled. Charles was more than a leader, more than a teacher. He was a friend. When we were afraid, he gave us strength. And when we were alone, he gave us a family. He may be gone, but his teachings... live on through us, his students. Whereverwe may go, we must carry on his vision. And that's a vision ofa world united. Kitty? Bobby? - You okay? - Yeah. Ah, it'sjust... Xavier came to my house. He was the one that convinced me to come here. Yeah, me too. We're all feelin' the same way, you know. No, Bobby, we're not. You have Rogue and I have― You know, I― I just miss home. The first snow and all ofthat. - Kitty, get up. Come with me. - Storm told us to stay in our rooms. Don't worry. We won't get caught. I mean, you can walk through walls, you know. Come on. This place can be home too. Bobby. Bobby! Okay. Come on. Whoa! Thank you for this, Bobby. You need a lift, kid? No. Where're you going? You don't know what it's like to be afraid ofyour powers, to be afraid to get close to anybody. Yeah, I do. I wanna be able to touch people, Logan. A hug, a handshake, a kiss. I hope you're not doing this for some boy. Look, ifyou wanna go, then go. Just be sure it's what you want. Shouldn't you be telling me to stay, to go upstairs and unpack? I'm not your father. I'm your friend. Think about what I said, Rogue. Marie. Do you remember when we first met? Do you know what I saw when I looked at you? I saw the next stage in evolution, what Charles and I dreamt offinding. And I thought to myself, \"Why would Charles... want to turn this goddess into a mortal?\" I can manipulate the metal in this, but you― you can do anything, anything you can think of. Jean― Enough. Enough! You sound just like him. Jean, he wanted to hold you back. What do you want? I want you to be what you are, as nature intended. That cure is meant for all of us. Ifwe want freedom, we must fight for it. And that fight begins now. She shouldn't be here with us. Her power's completely unstable. Only in the wrong hands. You trust her? She's one ofthem. So were you once. I stuck with you all the way. I would've killed the professor ifyou'd given me the chance. Charles Xavier did more for mutants than you'll ever know. My single greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live. So what now? What do we do? Professor Xavier started this school, perhaps it's best that it end with him. We'll have to tell the students they're going home. Must of us don't have anywhere to go. I can't believe this. I can't believe we're not gonna fight for this school. l'm sorry. l know this is a bad time. I was told that this was a safe place for mutants. It was, son. And it still is. We'll find you a room. Hank, tell all the students this school stays open. Rogue. Hey, Rogue. Hey, Pete, you seen Rogue? Yeah, she took off. Logan. Logan! Logan. Jean? Logan, where am l? Logan! Logan. Logan. Logan. God! Logan! Logan. Logan. Logan. Where are you goin'? Where do you think? She's gone, Logan. She's not comin' back. - You don't know that. - She killed the professor. It wasn'tJean. TheJean I know is still in there. Listen― Outta my way. Why can't you see the truth, huh? Why can't you just let her go? Because― Because― Because you love her. She made her choice. Now it's time we make ours. So ifyou're with us, then be with us. We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! Gettin' the cure so you can go back home to Mommy and Daddy? I'm lookin' for someone. Oh, l get it. Your girlfriend. I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic. Come on, Iceman. Make a move. Same old Bobby. Still afraid ofa fight! Today's attack was only our first salvo. So long as the cure exists, our warwill rage. Your cities will not be safe. Your streets will not be safe. You will not be safe. And to my fellow mutants, I make you this offer-- join us or stay out ofourway. Enough mutant blood has been spilled already. We're tryin' to track him, sir. We're working hard. We cannot let him do this. You know I agree, sir. This is now a national security matter. Seize and secure Worthington Labs. I want troops armed with cure weapons deployed immediately. Yes, sir. And, Trask, you have to find Magneto and stop him, by any means necessary. Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one. Let's go! Keep it movin'! Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal― bayonets, magazines, dog tags. Pick up your plastic weapons. Pick up your cure cartridge. Absolutely no metal. We don't need a cure. We don't need a cure. Members of the Brotherhood― They wish to cure us. But I say to you, we are the cure! The cure for their infirm, imperfect condition called... Homo sapiens. They have theirweapons. We have ours. We will strike with a vengeance and a fury... that this world has never witnessed. And ifany mutants stand in our way, we will use this poison against them. We shall go to Alcatraz Island, take control ofthe cure... and destroy its source. And then, nothing can stop us! Jean? l know the smell ofyour adamantium from a mile away. I didn't come here to fight you. - Smart boy. - I came forJean. You think I'm keeping her against her will? She's here because she wants to be. You don't know what you're dealing with. I know full well. I saw what she did to Charles. And you just stood there and let him die? I'm not leaving here without her. Yes, you are. Whoa― Okay. Two minutes to rendezvous, Mr. President. We have a satellite feed of Magneto's base ofoperations. - How did we find it? - She gave us everything we wanted and more. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Approaching target dead ahead. Set for 360-degree incursion. This is Team Leader to Bravo One. We are green to go. Okay. Send them in. Okay. Freeze, mutants! Get your hands in the air! Okay. I give up. Sorry, Mr. Secretary. lt was a decoy. If he's not there, then where the hell is he? Worthington Labs. It ends where it began. Are you sure the boy's still inside? 1 00%. So how we supposed to get there? 'Cause I don't swim. Leave that to me. Storm? Storm? What are you doing back here? I need help. You found her. Yeah. She's with Magneto. Where are they? They're on the move. I know where they're going. You're saying you saw Magneto? Yeah. Gotta go now. They're going to attack Alcatraz. There are troops stationed on that island. Not enough to stop him. Let's suit up. I don't believe this once fit me. If Magneto gets ahold ofthat cure, there will be no stopping him. Can you estimate how many he has? An army. And Jean. His powers have limits, hers do not. There's only six of us, Logan. Yeah. We're outnumbered. I'm not gonna lie to you. But we lost Scott. We lost the professor. lf we don't fight now, everything they stood for will die with them. I'm not gonna let that happen. Are you? Then we stand together, X-Men, all of us. We're in. Let's go. They're ready. Yeah, I know. But are you ready... to do what you need to do when the time comes? Dad, what's going on? It's an earthquake. We're trapped! Cheese― Charles always wanted to build bridges. My God! Fall back! Take cover! Fall back! The boy's in the southeast corner ofthe building. Well done. Let's take it down! In chess, the pawns go first. Humans and their guns. Plastic. They've learned. That's why the pawns go first. Target the bridge! Bring out the launcher! - This is it! - Ready! Load! Fire! Arclight, use your shock waves! Target those weapons! Oh, my stars and garters. Goin' to stealth mode. What aboutjets, tanks? Against Magneto? He'll turn 'em inside out. - Where are our ground troops? - Thirty minutes away. Then God help us. They're coming for him. Get the humans! Whoa! Don't ever do that again. You men, cover the doors! Everybody, get together! And hold this line! Traitors to their own cause. Finish them! Not yet. Go inside, get the boy and kill him. With pleasure. Hold it! - He's going for the boy! - Not if I get there first! Kitty! Come on! Grow those back. Don't you know who I am? I'm theJuggernaut, bitch! Going somewhere? You're the guy that invented the cure, right? Yes, I am. Girls? No! Don't! Don't hurt him! - No! Don't hurt him! - Let go ofme! l didn't do anything. Calm down. Calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. I thought you were a diplomat. As Churchill said, \"There comes a time when all men must―\" Oh, you get the point! Oh, no! No. Please! No, no, don't! No! No, don't worry. I'm here to help you. I'm gonna get you out of here. This way. Oh, my God. What's going on? Your powers won't work with me. Stay close, all right? Okay. I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with. Who's hiding, dickhead? Don't! No! Don't! D― Please, don't do this! I only wanted to help you people. Do we look like we need your help? It's time to end this war. Take cover! Get out ofthe way! Come on! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! We work as a team. Best defense is a good offense. Run! Bobby! You thinkyou can take out your old friend? Go ahead. Storm, we're gonna need some cover. Right. You're in over your head, Bobby. Maybe you should go back to school. You never should've left. This is it. Hey. Make it a strike. You never learn, do you? Actually, I do. I'm― One ofthem? This is what they want for all of us. It's over,Jean. It's over. No! Don't shoot! No! No-- Everybody, get out of here! Bobby! What have I done? I'm the only one who can stop her. Get everyone to safety. Go! Jean! Jean, I know you're still there! You would die for them? No. Not for them. For you. For you. Save me. I love you. No! You're back. I'm sorry. I had to. This isn't what I wanted. I know. It's what I wanted. Don't worry, Dad. l'll call. Hey. Good to see you, buddy. And so it is with the thanks ofa grateful nation... that I introduce our new ambassador to the United Nations... and the representative to the world... for all United States citizens, human and mutant alike— Dr. Hank McCoy. Way to go, furball. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. Hello, Moira.

Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.", "content": "Mama! Mama! Mama! Mother. What are you... I thought you were a burglar. I didn't mean to scare you, darling. I was just getting a snack. Go back to bed. What's the matter? Go on, back to bed. I'll make you a hot chocolate. Who are you? And what have you done with my mother? My mother has never set foot in this kitchen in her life. And she certainly never made me a hot chocolate. Unless you count ordering the maid to do it. You're not scared of me? I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. The only person who was different. And here you are. Charles Xavier. Raven. You're hungry and alone. Take whatever you want. We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal. In fact, you never have to steal again. Understand this, Erik... These Nazis, I'm not like them. Genes are the key, yes? But their goals? Blue eyes? Blond hair? Pathetic. Mmm! Eat the chocolate. It's good. Want some? I want to see my mama. Genes are the key that unlocks the door to a new age, Erik. A new future for mankind. Evolution. You know what I'm talking about? It's a simple thing I ask of you. A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate. Is it? Ja. I tried, herr doctor. I can't... I don't... It's impossible. The one thing I can say for the Nazis is their methods seem to produce results. I'm sorry, Erik. Mama! My darling. How are you? Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to count to three... And you're going to move the coin. You don't move the coin, I pull the trigger. Understand? One. Mama. You can do it. Two. Everything is all right. Three. Yes. Wonderful. Excellent. Nein! Outstanding, Erik. So we unlock your gift with anger. Anger and pain. You and me... We're going to have a lot of fun together. Heterochromia. A gentleman would at least offer to buy me a drink first. Norman, a pint of bitter for me and a Brandy for the lady, please. How did you know that? Lucky guess. My name is Xavier. Charles Xavier. How do you do? Amy. Heterochromia was in reference to your eyes, which I have to say are stunning. One green, one blue. It's a mutation. It's a very groovy mutation. I've got news for you, Amy. You are a mutant. First you proposition a girl, and then you call her deformed. How is that seduction technique working for you? I'll tell you in the morning. No, seriously, though, you mustn't knock it. Mutation took us from single-celled organisms to being the dominant form of reproductive life on this planet. Infinite forms of variation with each generation, all through mutation. Then let's reclaim that word. Mutant and proud. Chin-chin. Hey. I guess I have to buy my own drink. I'm sorry. One cola. Charles here was just telling me that I'm like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs. A tiny bit sexier. I'm sorry. This is my sister, raven. Hi. Amy. And what do you study? Waitressing. Ah. Oh, look, you have heterochromia, too. Sorry, what? Look at her eye. Right. Raven, get your coat, please. Don't talk to me. You did that on purpose. I did not! Why would I do it on purpose? Yes, you did! You know I can't control it sometimes if I'm stressed or tired. You seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now. \"Mutant and proud.\" What? Or is it only with pretty mutations, or invisible ones like yours? But if you're a freak, you better hide. You're being ridiculous. I don't mean to sound like an old fart. Which you are. Sometimes. But we've talked about this, raven. A small slip-up is one thing. A big one does not bear thinking about. \"Mutant and proud.\" \"Mutant and proud\"? If only. Would you date me? Of course I would. Any young man would be lucky to have you. You are stunning. Looking like this? Like... what? Blue? You're my oldest friend. I'm your only friend. Thank you for that. Well? I'm incapable of thinking of you that way. I feel responsible for you. Anything else would just feel wrong. But what if you didn't know me? Unfortunately, I do know you. I don't know what's gotten into you lately. You're awfully concerned with your looks. I'm sleepy. Will you read to me? I can't. I have my thesis coming up. I have to study. Fine, read that. Your thesis always sends me right off. \"To homo neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin, homo sapiens,\" \"was an aberration.\" \"Peaceful cohabitation, if ever it existed, was short-lived.\" \"Records show, without exception,\" \"that the arrival of the mutated human species in any region\" \"was followed by the immediate extinction\" \"of their less-evolved kin.\" Possession of that gold is illegal. I should inform the police. Let's not play this game. Where did you get it? A friend. He recommended your bank most highly. I see. Do you know our terms, sir? Yes. And you should know mine. This gold is what remains of my people. Melted from their possessions. Torn from their teeth. This is blood money. And you're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it. Don't touch that alarm. I want schmidt. Klaus schmidt. Where is he? Our clients don't provide addresses. We're not... Not that sort of bank? Metal fillings, eh? Not gold. Worried someone might steal them? Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina! Villa gesell! Please! Thank you. I would love to kill you. So mark my words. If you warn anyone I'm coming... I will find you. Another day at the office. Is that colonel hendry? The NATO guy? Yeah. Yes, it is. Because that's three mob bosses, the Italian ambassador and the ceo of lockheed. They can't all be communists. This hellfire club, it's got to be something else. Do you see that? Hello, girls. Wow! Very nice. What are you doing? Using some equipment the CIA didn't give me. Stay put. Colonel hendry? Yes, ma'am. Emma frost. Sebastian Shaw's associate. And where is Mr. Shaw? We're having a party, and here's the entertainment. Come with me. Down like a roller coaster. Back like a loop-the-loop. And around like a merry-go-round. We ate and ate at a hot dog stand. We danced around to a rocking band. And when I could, I gave that girl a hug. In the tunnel of love. You'll never know how great a kiss can feel. When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel. When I fell in love down at palisades park. Hello, beautiful. How are you? Hey, baby. You want to find a quiet place? I am so sorry. I've been booked by colonel hendry. Excuse me. We ate and ate at a hot dog stand. We danced around to a rocking band. And when I could, I gave that girl a hug. In the tunnel of love. You'll never know how great a kiss can feel. You sure we can't get you a refill, Bob? No. So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey. I expect you'll reconsider. We've had this conversation. You put our nukes in Turkey or anywhere that close to Russia, and you're looking at war. Nuclear war. I don't ask for favors, colonel. I express my expectations. So, let me say it again. I expect you'll reconsider. The only thing I will reconsider is having another glass of that delicious champagne. What the hell did you put in my drink? You're thinking of running. Hiding. We'd find you, hendry. There's not a fortress in the world that could keep us out. Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob? Genetic mutation. The evolution of the human genome. Where's azazel? Ah. We don't want the colonel to be late. Comrade. Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message. If we ever decide to fire them, the Russian early-warning system won't even have time to kick in. This better be important, mactaggert. Whoa, slow down. Are you smoking them funny cigarettes? People don't disappear. Colonel hendry was there. He was there, mccone, in the hellfire club. Colonel hendry? I agree with you, general. I've reconsidered my position and I now believe we should put Jupiter missiles in Turkey. Colonel hendry is here. So unless he magically traveled 3,000 Miles in the last 10 minutes, listen to me, I suggest that you stop wasting my time. Looks like hendry wants to start world war III. I got bigger things to deal with right now, mactaggert. Sir, I... God! Have you lost your mind? So, now what? We find an expert on genetic mutation. PR ofessor of genetics, Charles Francis Xavier. So, how does it feel to be a Professor? Don't call me that. You don't get to be called a Professor until you actually have a teaching position. I know, but it suits you. Don't say that. Do say, \"let's go have a drink.\" Let's go have a drink. Wonderful. Afternoon, gentlemen. Hot out there. Beer, please. German beer. Of course. Yes, it's bitburger. You like it? The best. What brings you to Argentina? The climate. I'm a pig farmer. Tailor. Since I was a boy. My father made the finest suits in Dusseldorf. My parents were from Dusseldorf. Ah. What was their name? They didn't have a name. It was taken away from them... By pig farmers... And tailors. Blood and honor. Which would you care to shed first? We were under orders... Blood then. Freeze, asshole. Come on, shoot. Who... what are you? Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster. And I'm looking for my creator. Drink! Drink! Drink! Yeah! I'm so proud of you. Thank you. I need another drink. And you need another cola. Congratulations, Professor. Thank you very much. It's much harder than it looks, actually. No, on your presentation. You were at my presentation? How nice of you. Thank you very much. Moira mactaggert. Charles Xavier. Do you have a minute? For a pretty little bean with a mutated mcrl gene? I have five. I say \"MCRL,\" you would say \"AUBURN HAIR.\" It's a mutation. It's a very groovy mutation. Mutation, right, took us from single-celled organisms to the dominant form... You know what? This routine may go over great with the co-eds, but I'm here on business. What? I really need your help. All right. The kind of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis. I need to know if they may have already happened. In people alive today. Professor? I think we should just talk when you're sober. Do you have any time tomorrow? Something tells me you already know the answer to your question. This is very important to me, and if I can help you, I will do my utmost. Thank you. Still drinking champagne, Bob? I will pass. Okay, well, so much for the pleasantries. I was wondering who you told about our little arrangement. No one. - He's telling the truth. - Good. Well, I guess we're done here. Let's wrap things up, shall we? Oh, I knew better than to trust you. Now, you let me walk out of here with my money, or I will pull this pin, and we all die. Go ahead. Pull it. I'll do it, I swear to God. No, you won't. But I will. You're one of them? Very astute of you, colonel hendry. You want to guess what I can do? I've got the power to absorb energy. It keeps me young. But that's the boring part. The fun stuff is what I can do with it once I've got it. The advent of the nuclear age may have accelerated the mutation process. Individuals with extraordinary abilities may already be among us. Thank you very much. Mactaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist is going to make me believe in sparkly dames and vanishing men? You just bought yourself a one-way ticket back to the typing pool. This meeting is over. Please sit down, agent mactaggert. I didn't really expect you to believe me, given that all you could think about during my presentation was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary. It's apple pecan. I haven't been entirely honest with you, love. I'm sorry. You see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do is that I can read your mind. I've seen this before in a magic show. Are you going to ask us to think of a number between one and 10 now? No, agent stryker. Although, I could ask you about your son, William, who you were thinking about, which is very nice. But I think I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter missiles America are currently placing in Turkey. He's a goddamn spy. You brought a goddamned spy into this facility! How's that for a magic trick? Best I've ever seen. I want them out of here. And locked down until I can figure out what to do. My facility is off-site. I'll take them. I can't believe this. You'd think the director of the CIA would have a little more composure. We should be going after Shaw right now. But instead, he's out there worrying about the wrong mutants. What are we going to do, levene? Levene? Levene, what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing. I've just frozen him for a moment because I'd like to talk to you. It's good, isn't it? I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are. If you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage. I've always known that there were people like you out there. I've been the laughing stock of this agency for years, but I knew it! You are going to love my facility. - That's going to have to wait. - Why? Agent mactaggert has a lead on Sebastian Shaw, and if we don't move now, apparently, we're going to lose him. What? Not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well. Moira and I have just had a lovely conversation. Yes, we did. That is incredible! But I cannot take you anywhere else without permission from upstairs. Like to see one more magic trick? Okay. Get in the car. Good idea. Herr doktor. Little Erik lensherr. He's here to kill you. What kind of a greeting is that... After all these years? Emma. We don't harm our own kind. Ah! Now it's a party. This is the us coast guard. Do not attempt to move your vessel. Stay where you are. They have a telepath. I've lost Shaw. I've lost Shaw. There's something blocking me. This has never happened to me before. I think there's someone like me on that ship. Like you? I'm sorry, a telepath. This is incredible. I could actually feel her inside my mind. I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be much help tonight. You're on your own. Oh, my God! Jesus! Get inside. Stop, stop, stop. Charles! Are you okay? There's someone else out there. There. Time to go. Let go! You have to let it go! You've got to put someone in the water to help him. Let it go! You have to let it go! You can't. You'll drown. You have to let go. I know what this means to you, but you're going to die. Please, Erik, calm your mind. Get off me! Get off! Calm down! Just breathe. We're here! Who are you? My name is Charles Xavier. You were in my head. How did you do that? You have your tricks, I have mine. I'm like you. Just calm your mind. I thought I was alone. You're not alone. Erik, you're not alone. Welcome to my facility. My mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers in military defense. Or offense. This guy Shaw, schmidt, whatever you want to call him, he's working with the Russians. We might need your help to stop him. Marvelous. So we're to be the CIA's new mutant division, yes? Something like that. It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane ever built. You should see it in real life. It's incredible. Hank, these are the special new recruits I was telling you about. This is Hank McCoy, one of our most talented young researchers. How wonderful. Another mutant, already here. Why didn't you say? Say what? Because you don't know. I am so, so terribly sorry. Hank? You didn't ask, so I didn't tell. So, your mutation is what? You're super-smart? I'll say. Hank here graduated Harvard at the age of 15. I wish that's all it was. You're among friends now, Hank. You can show off. Splendid. I'm sorry. Ta-da! You're amazing. Really? \"The presence of us missiles in Turkey\" \"represents an unprecedented threat\" \"to the people of the Soviet union,\" warned Russian foreign minister gromyko earlier today. But he was quick to insist the Russians would not be the first to initiate any military action. Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as we get to Russia. Unless the CIA find us first. I'll take care of them, too. If that telepath gets inside your head, he won't be as much fun as I am. Already in hand, my love. The Russians made me this. So, what am I thinking? I don't know. I was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing I have ever seen in my life. And that this needs ice. Fetch me some. There's a good girl. I promised myself I'd find a cure ever since I was a little boy. You have no idea what I'd give to feel normal. Normal. Charles has never understood. He's different, but he's never had to hide. Hank, this serum that you're making, it doesn't affect abilities, right? Just appearance. It normalizes it. Yeah. Do you think it would work on me? I can look into it, if you'd like. It's the least I can do after asking you to come down here with such a weird request. I have to admit, usually when guys ask me out, they're not after my blood. Sorry. I didn't intend to be forward. I was just... I was excited. You know, the nature of your mutation. If any genes hold the key to changing appearance, it's yours. Hank, you weren't being forward. That's kind of what I meant. No. But I'm just sorry if you thought I was. And I'm sorry that you weren't. Go ahead. Take the blood. Sorry. Did I hurt you? Kinky. By the way, if I looked like you, I wouldn't change a thing. From what I know about you, I'm surprised you've managed to stay this long. What do you know about me? Everything. Then you know to stay out of my head. I'm sorry, Erik, but I've seen what Shaw did to you. I've felt your agony. I can help you. I don't need your help. Don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night. It's not just me you're walking away from. Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself. I won't stop you leaving. I could. But I won't. Shaw has got friends. You could do with some. Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter. It's designed to amplify brainwaves so it could enhance your telepathic powers, help us find other mutants for our division. What if they don't want to be found by you? Erik. You decided to stay. If a new species is being discovered, it should be by it's own kind. Charles and I find the mutants. No suits. First of all, that's my machine out there. Second of all, and much more importantly, this is Charles' decision. Charles is fine with the CIA being involved. Isn't that right? No. I'm sorry, but I'm with Erik. We'll find them alone. What if I say no? Then good luck using your installation without me. I call it cerebro. As in the Spanish for \"brain.\" Yes. Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles to the transmitter on the roof. When he picks up a mutant, his brain sends a signal through a relay and then the co-ordinates of their location are printed out here. You designed this? Yeah. What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles. Don't spoil this for me, Erik. I've been a lab rat. I know one when I see one. Okay, great. Are you sure we can't shave your head? Don't touch my hair. Okay. It's working! For that, daddy-o, you get a private dance. You cats know it's double for both, right? Mmm. No, that won't be necessary. Although, I'm sure it'd be magical. We were thinking more, we'll show you ours if you show us yours. Baby, that is not the way it works around here. More tea, vicar? Don't mind if I do. My turn. How would you like a job where you get to keep your clothes on? Where to, fellas? Richmond, Virginia, please. Right, so, you want the airport? The station? What? No, we were rather hoping you would take us all the way. That's a six-hour drive. That will give us plenty of time to talk. What does the government want with a guy like Alex summers? I hope you're not planning on putting him with others. First guy I've ever met who actually prefers solitary confinement. Crazy, huh? What? You like fish. I like fish, too. Maybe we should get a bite sometime, talk about it? I'd rather go out with the fish. These fish? Excuse me, I'm Erik lensherr. Charles Xavier. Go fuck yourself. There's nothing on radar? Nothing. Sonar? Nyet. Then we have a problem. Beautiful, isn't it? The reason we exist. We are the children of the atom, my love. We have a situation. The telepath. I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance. It's like his reach is amplified. They're recruiting. You go on to Russia. I'll handle them. I can't stop thinking about the others out there. All those minds that I touched. I could feel them. Their isolation, their hopes, their ambitions. I tell you, we are at the start of something incredible, Erik. We can help them. Can we? Identification, that's how it starts. And ends with being rounded up, experimented on, eliminated. Not this time. We have common enemies. Shaw, the Russians. They need us. For now. We should think of code names. We're government agents now, we should have secret code names. I want to be called mystique. Damn! I wanted to be called mystique. Well, tough. I called it. And I'm way more mysterious than you. Darwin, what about you? Well, \"Darwin\" is already a nickname, and, you know, it sort of fits. Adapt to survive and all. Check this out. Whoa! That was incredible. Thank you. What about you? I'm going to be. Banshee. Why do you want to be named after a wailing spirit? You might want to cover your ears. Your turn. My stage name is angel. It kind of fits. You can fly? Uh-huh. And... What's your name? How about big foot? You know what they say about guys with big feet. And yours are kind of small. Okay, now. Alex, what is your gift? What can you do? It's not... I just can't do it. I can't do it in here. Why don't you just do it out there? Alex! Alex! Alex! That's the spirit! Get down when I tell you. \"Get down when I tell you.\" Get back. Get back! Whatever. We have intel that Shaw is meeting with the Russian defense chief in moscow. So go ahead. Say it. I'm not here to say \"I told you so.\" You know why I'm here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring along your mutants. Fight fire with fire. It makes sense. Wait! You're okay with this? Sending in a bunch of untrained, unauthorized freaks? These freaks are dedicated, hardworking people. Plane leaves for Russia in an hour. I'm telling you, these kids are not ready for Shaw. I think they're gonna surprise you. They're an exceptional bunch of young people. What the hell? Come on! You can go harder than that. Harder! What are you doing? Who destroyed the statue? It was Alex. No, havok. We have to call him havok. That's his name now. And we were thinking, you should be Professor x and you should be Magneto. Exceptional. I expect more from you. We got a problem. What? I'm so sorry. This wasn't on the map. No matter what happens, act normally. I'll take care of this, all right? Now, listen to me... - Where are you going? - To our farm. Open the back. As you wish. Easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps. - Anything back there? - Nothing. It's empty. - Everything okay? - Yes. - Where is Shaw? - I don't know. But if she's a telepath and I read her, she'll know we're here. Let me try something else. Shaw sends his apologies but he's indisposed. He asked me to come in his place. And between you and I, honey, I'm a lot better company. Please, come in. He's not coming. So, what now, boss? Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw. Mission aborted. The hell it is. Erik. She's his right-hand woman. That's good enough for me. The CIA invading the home of a senior Soviet official. Are you crazy? I'm not CIA. Erik! Your health. So, you must be busy planning your next move. What with the Americans refusing to remove their missiles from Turkey. You know I can't talk about those things, miss frost. Emma. And don't worry. You don't have to say a word. He's gonna start world war III single-handed. We have to do something. Like what? We're moving out. You can't! I'm sorry. I can't leave him. For God's sake, Erik! Be calm. Be calm. Forget my face. You are beautiful, so beautiful! Yes! Pathetic. Yes! Nice trick. Who are you? Go to sleep. You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar. You're never going to get anything from me while I'm like this. So, then, you can just tell us. Where is Shaw? Erik. Erik, that's enough. Erik, that's enough! All yours. She won't be shifting into diamond form again. And if she does, just give her a gentle tap. We are the children of the atom. Radiation gave birth to mutants. What will kill the humans will only make us stronger. Beautiful, isn't it? This is worse than we previously imagined. We're taking you with us. CIA will want to question you themselves. Oh, I doubt it. They have bigger things to worry about right now. - Whoa! - All right, all right. Jesus, man, you are killing me. Don't beat yourself up. I've had a lot of spare time. Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town. Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little... No? Come on, let's see the foot. There it is. Come on, big foot, let's go. Hey. Hey, come on. Hey. They're just guys being stupid. Guys being stupid, I can handle. Okay? I've handled that my whole life. But I'd rather a bunch of guys stare at me with my clothes off than the way these ones stare at me. At us. What was that? I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. No news of Shaw? Not a peep. Not even through that back channel? What is that? We have an intruder in the main atrium. Where are the mutants? If you take another step, I'm gonna put you down. Of course you will. But where do I find the more evolved people? Send back-up now! Get back! Do not leave that room. We're under attack! Shoot! Shoot! Where are the mutants? Put that man down or we will open fire! Stay here, my ass! Let's go! Get back! We can help! We can help! Wait! You want the mutants? They're right through that door. Just let us normal people go. We're no threat... - Where is the telepath? - Not here. Too bad. Well, at least I can take this silly thing off. Good evening. My name is Sebastian Shaw. And I am not here to hurt you. Freeze! Azazel. My friends, there is a revolution coming. When mankind discovers who we are, what we can do, each of us will face a choice. Be enslaved or rise up to rule. Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us, then, by definition, you are against us. So, you can stay and fight for the people who hate and fear you, and queens. Angel. Are you kidding me? Come on. We don't belong here. And that's nothing to be ashamed of. We have to do something. Stop. I'm coming with you. Good choice. So, tell me about your mutation. Well, I adapt to survive. So, I guess I'm coming with you. I like that. Alex! Get out! Do it! Protecting your fellow mutants? That's a noble gesture. Feels good. Adapt to this. Hello. Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA. These Americans are ruthless. Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey... I expect you'll be planning new missile sites of your own. Somewhere you know the American early-warning system won't help. I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year. And so close to Florida. Missiles in Cuba? You're serious? We may as well declare war. Maybe I wasn't clear enough. You will make this happen. Okay. Let's see what kgb think about this. Hello? General armivolkoff. It's nothing. Raven? We've made arrangements for you to be taken home immediately. We're not going home. What? He's not going back to prison. He killed Darwin. All the more reason for you to leave. This is over. Darwin's dead, Charles. And we can't even bury him. We can avenge him. Erik, a word, please. They're just kids. No. They were kids. Shaw has his army, we need ours. We'll have to train. All of us. Yes? Yeah. Well, we can't stay here. Even if they reopen the department, it's not safe. We've got nowhere to go. Yes, we do. The law says we've got to turn her over. The law applies to human beings. The same laws don't apply to mutants. They're too dangerous. In times like this, security is more important than liberty. There is a war coming, John. Yes, but a war with who? Excellent question. Though I wouldn't call it a war, exactly. That suggests both sides stand an equal chance of winning. Captain, no sign of any American ships. Maintain course, full ahead. The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba. We have a week before the ship hits the coast. Our fleet can be on this line when the Russian missile ship arrives. If that ship crosses the line, they will have declared war against the United States. And we will have no choice but to retaliate with a full nuclear response. Do we agree? Dispatch the 7th fleet. This is yours? No, it's ours. Honestly, Charles. I don't know how you survived, living in such hardship. Well, it was a hardship softened by me. Come on. Time for the tour. Dear comrades... The United States have dispatched warships for Cuba. This leaves us with no choice. Comrade first secretary... We must send in our fleet. Dispatch the fleet! President Kennedy has signed a formal proclamation setting up a blockade of all missiles bound for Cuba. The Soviet union reacted by terming it. \"A step along the road to unleashing a thermo-nuclear war.\" You're sure? I'm sure. All right. No. No, I can't. I'm sorry. I can't shoot anybody point blank, let alone my friend. Oh, come on. You know I can deflect it. You're always telling me I should push myself. If you know you can deflect it, then you're not challenging yourself. Whatever happened to the man who was trying to raise a submarine? I can't. Something that big? I need the situation, the anger... No, the anger is not enough. It's gotten the job done all this time. It's nearly gotten you killed all this time. Come here. Let's try something a little more challenging. My stepfather took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously. This way. That is why he had this bunker built down here. I thought we could use it as a practice range of sorts. You don't think I'm going to blow through the walls? He had this place built to withstand a nuclear bomb. I think it can handle you, Alex. You know, when I do this, bad things tend to happen. That's because you can't control it. It controls you. That's why we're here, Alex. It's why we're training. What you're doing is incredible. You're hitting a pitch with sound waves that have the same resonant frequency as the glass. That's why it shatters. But this, it's like any other muscle in the body. You can control it. \"In each of us, two natures are at war.\" Robert Louis Stevenson, Jekyll and Hyde. Top marks. The story wasn't really about good and evil though, was it? It was about man's animal nature and his struggle to control it, to conform. And it's that struggle which is holding you back. No, Jekyll was afraid of what he could be capable of. And you are, too. If you're serious about me doing this, you might want to get back. All right. Shall I shut the door? Yeah. Whenever you're ready. Oh, my God! I will teach you to control this, Alex. And you're sure that this will work? Anything is possible. I based the design... Hank, stop talking. Come on. Now, remember. Scream as hard as you can. You need the sound waves to be supersonic. Catch them at the right angle and they should carry you. They should carry me. That's reassuring. Good luck. And don't forget to scream. Now, if you want to beat me this time, you have to set the beast free. On your marks, get set, go! Congratulations, my friend. Robert Louis Stevenson would have been proud. Impressive, Hank. With feet like those, all you need is a red nose. Right, bozo? I'm done here. Thank you, Alex. Come on, Hank. If you're using half your concentration to look normal, then you're only half paying attention to whatever else you're doing. Just pointing out something that could save your life. You want society to accept you, but you can't even accept yourself. Sexy! Well, this is just the prototype. The real one will look considerably better. It will be a whole suit. See, these sensors measure your energy output. This panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed. Try hitting the one in the middle. Just the one in the middle, mind. Good luck. You got to see this. Your genes are extraordinary, you know that? Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human. When you're 40, you'll still have the leucocytes of a teenager. You have the most incredible cellular structure I've ever seen. And you truly believe I'll fly this time? Unreservedly. I trust you. I'm touched. I don't trust him. Say nothing. I'm gonna die! Look, we're not going to make you do anything you don't feel... Here, let me help. Erik! What? You know you were thinking the same. Wonderful work, Hank. Thank you very much. All right, Alex, I want you to hit the \"X\". And try not to hit me. There's a good chap. You're serious? I'm very serious. I have complete and utter faith in you. Am I still a bozo? Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo. But nice job. See that? Try turning it to face us. You know, I believe that true focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity. Would you mind if I... What did you just do to me? I accessed the brightest corner of your memory system. It's a very beautiful memory, Erik. Thank you. I didn't know I still had that. There is so much more to you than you know. Not just pain and anger. There is good, too. I felt it. When you can access all of that, you'll possess a power no one can match. Not even me. So, come on. Try again. Hey! Well done. The president is about to make his address. It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile crossing the embargo line that surrounds Cuba as an attack by the Soviet union on the United States requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet union... That's where we're going to find Shaw. How do you know? Two superpowers facing off and he wants to start world war III. He won't leave anything to chance. So much for diplomacy. I suggest you all get a good night's sleep. Ultimately leads to war. Tensions mount as the Soviet missile ship nears Cuba. All diplomatic efforts to avert nuclear war have thus far failed. As the American people ready themselves for the likelihood of an atomic attack, there are widespread reports of panic-buying, supermarkets cleared, as shelters unused since the second world war are stocked for what may lie ahead. In all it's history, America has never faced a greater threat. The world is primed for war and there's no one to stop me. Come in. Hey. I have a surprise for you. I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample. The serum works like an antibiotic, attacking the cells that 'cause our physical mutation. It won't affect our abilities, just our appearance. Do you still want to do this? Should we have to hide? Well, you already do. You're hiding right now, like I have my whole life. I don't want to feel like a freak all the time. I just want to look... Normal. Yeah. Hank, don't! You're beautiful, Hank. Everything you are, you are perfect. Look at all of us. Look at all we've achieved this week. All we will achieve. We are different. But we shouldn't be trying to fit into society. Society should aspire to be more like us. Mutant and proud. It behooves me to tell you that even if we save the world tomorrow, and mutants are accepted into society, my feet and your natural blue form will never be deemed beautiful. You look beautiful now. We need this cure. Cuba. Russia, America. It makes no difference. Shaw has declared war on mankind, on all of us. He has to be stopped. I'm not going to stop Shaw. I'm going to kill him. Do you have it in you to allow that? You've known all along why I was here, Charles. But things have changed. What started as a covert mission, tomorrow, mankind will know that mutants exist. Shaw, us, they won't differentiate. They'll fear us. And that fear will turn to hatred. Not if we stop a war. Not if we can prevent Shaw. Not if we risk our lives doing so. Would they do the same for us? We have it in us to be the better men. We already are. We're the next stage of human evolution. You said it yourself! No... Are you really so naive as to think that they won't battle their own extinction? Or is it arrogance? I'm sorry? After tomorrow, they're going to turn on us. But you're blind to it, because you believe they're all like moira. And you believe they're all like Shaw. Listen to me very carefully, my friend. Killing Shaw will not bring you peace. Peace was never an option. No. No, no. No. Well, this is a surprise. The nice kind? Get out, raven. I want to go to bed. Maybe in a few years. How about now? I prefer the real raven. I said the real raven. Perfection. Could you pass me my robe? You don't have to hide. Have you ever looked at a tiger and thought you ought to cover it up? No, but... You're an exquisite creature, raven. All your life, the world has tried to tame you. It's time for you to be free. You know, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if you hadn't found me here that night. Sorry, what? You... For God's sake, raven! Where are your clothes? Put some clothes on. That's not what you said when you first saw me. But I guess pets are always cuter when they're little, right? Raven, I don't know what's gotten into you lately. I thought you'd be in a good mood. Hank, he tells me that he's found the answer to your cosmetic problem. Are you gonna tell me what's the matter or do I have to read your mind? You promised me you would never do that. Until recently, I never had to use my power to know what you were thinking, raven. Charles, I used to think it was going to be you and me against the world. But no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you? You want to be a part of it. What the hell happened here? Hank has been busy. Do we really have to wear these? As none of us mutated to endure extreme g-force or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up. Where is Hank? I'm here. Hank? It didn't attack the cells. It enhanced them. It didn't work. Yes, it did, Hank. Don't you see? This is who you were meant to be. This is you. No more hiding. You never looked better, man. Hank! Don't mock me! Hank, put him down immediately, please. Hank! Hank! I wasn't. Even I got to admit you look pretty badass. I think I got a new name for you. Beast. You're sure you can fly this thing? Of course I can. I designed it. Status of the cargo ship. Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots. Three minutes to the embargo line, sir. God help them if they cross it. God help us all. Sound general quarters. General quarters, general quarters! - All hands, man battle stations! - Aye, sir. Set condition zebra! General quarters, battle stations. Captain, we already have our orders. Why so eager for new ones? I lived through one war, comrade. I'd prefer not to start another. Battle stations! Now! Gun boss, target cargo ship bearing 1-8-0. Fleet reports all weapons ready. From the kremlin, sir. New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo vessel aral sea is hereby ordered to... Reverse course and return to port in Odessa. Aral sea, come in. They are not responding. She's not turning around. Aral sea, you are ordered to turn around. Do not cross the line. Target ready to be fired upon, sir. Stand by to fire. Standing by, sir. Whoa! It looks pretty messy out there. Aral sea you are ordered to turn around. The crew of the aral sea are all dead. Shaw's been there. He's still here, somewhere. He set the ship on course for the embargo line. If that ship crosses the line, our boys are going to blow it up. And the war begins. Unless they're not our boys. USS independence, this is Alexander nevsky. We have lost control of our cargo ship. She has been instructed to stop. Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire! They have signaled the cargo ship to turn around, sir. It's a ruse. Pay no attention! Stand by to fire. Standing by to fire, sir. On my count. Five, four... Hold on! Nyet. What was that? The Russians. They have fired on their own ship. A little warning next time, Professor. Sorry about that. You all right? Yeah. Son of a... Give me cinclant on the horn. I want a new set of orders. Congratulations, comrade. You just averted nuclear war! What? Take him to the brig. What? What just happened? They say the comrade lost his mind. The Americans are applauding. They're here. That telepath is powerful. We're moving to a back-up plan. That was inspired, Charles. Thank you very much, but I still can't locate Shaw. He's down there. We need to find him now. Hank? Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners? No. Nothing. Well, then he must be underwater. And obviously, we don't have sonar. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. They are ready for war. We just need to strike another match to light the fuse. And we still have the most powerful weapon of all. Me. Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output and make sure I'm not disturbed. Hank, level the bloody plane! Whoa! You back right off. Beast, open the bomb bay doors! Remember! This is a muscle. You control it! You'll be in here the entire time! We'll see you soon! On my mark! Three! Two! One! Go! Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cans off. Banshee has got a location on Shaw. Are you ready for this? Let's find out. Remember, the point between rage and serenity. Erik, take my hand! Oh. Hold on, guys. It's gonna get bumpy. Erik, take my hand! Moira? Moira, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. I read the teleporter's mind. Shaw is drawing all the power out of his sub. He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb. We got no time. The geiger count is going out of control. Moira, this is what we're gonna do. Get on the radio and tell them to clear both fleets out immediately. I'm going in. Beast, havok, back him up. Erik, I can guide you through once you're in, but I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me, then we just hope to God it's not too late for me to stop him. Got it. Good luck! Raven, stop! I'm going to help them. We don't have time for this. If anything comes in that entrance, you're taking care of it, yes? Fine. Beast! If we go, you go! We believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb. Erik, make for the middle of the vessel. That's the point my mind can't penetrate. We have to assume that that's where Shaw is. Gangway! Gangway! Gangway! That's the nuclear reactor. Disable it. Stop! Don't move! Get down! Erik, you're there. You've reached the void. He's not here, Charles. Shaw's not here! He's left the sub! What? He's got to be there. He has to be! There's nowhere else he can be. Keep looking. And I'm telling you he's not. There's no one here, God damn it! Erik. What a pleasant surprise. Erik? Erik. So good to see you again. May I ask you something? Why are you on their side? He's gone. What? He's gone into the void! I can't communicate with him there. Why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end? Yeah! Yes! I'm sorry for what happened in the camps. I truly am. He's back! Erik, whatever you're doing, keep doing it. It's starting to work. But everything I did, I did for you. To unlock your power, to make you embrace it. It's working! I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind. You've come a long way from bending gates. I'm so proud of you. And you're just starting to scratch the surface. Think how much further we could go together. Look out! Stop! Azazel. I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I never did. I want to help you. This is our time. Our age. We are the future of the human race. You and me, son. This world could be ours. Everything you did made me stronger. It made me the weapon I am today. It's the truth. I've known it all along. You are my creator. Now, Charles! Are you okay? Moira, be quiet. I can only control this man for so long. - Sorry, Charles. - Erik, please. Be the better man. It's not that I don't trust you. Erik, there will be no turning back! No! Charles! Don't do this, Erik! If you're in there, I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you said. We are the future. But, unfortunately, you killed my mother. This is what we're going to do. No. Please, Erik, no. I'm going to count to three and I'm going to move the coin. One. Please, Erik. Two. Three. The Russians share our concerns and will join a strike on all the mutants. We can end this threat for good. We'll never have another opportunity like this. We have an agent on that beach. One agent. She's a good agent. She's collateral damage. Today, our fighting stops! Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters. The real enemy is out there. I feel their guns moving in the water, their metal targeting us. Americans, Soviets, humans. United in their fear of the unknown. The neanderthal is running scared, my fellow mutants! Go ahead, Charles. Tell me I'm wrong. Fleet commander, this is X-ray bravo 7-0. Respond. Over. The beach is secure. Call off the attack. The beach is targeted and ready to be fired upon, sir. Stand by. Standing by, sir. New orders. Fire on the beach. Hello? Hello! Fire! Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men. This is the time to prove it. There are thousands of men on those ships. Good, honest, innocent men! They're just following orders. I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again. Erik, release them! No! I don't want to hurt you. Don't make me! Stand back! Charles, that's enough! Erik, stop! Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you. Comrades, thank you for your service. I'm so sorry. I said back off! You. You did this. Erik. Please. She didn't do this, Erik. You did. Us turning on each other, it's what they want. I tried to warn you, Charles. I want you by my side. We're brothers, you and I. All of us together, protecting each other. We want the same thing. My friend. I'm sorry, but we do not. Charles! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. It's all right. This society won't accept us. We form our own. The humans have played their hand. Now we get ready to play ours. Who's with me? No more hiding. You should go with him. It's what you want. You promised me you would never read my mind. I know. I promised you a great many things, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. Take care of him. And, beast, never forget. Mutant and proud. Help me out, come on. I'm gonna get you to a hospital. Wait, Charles. Charles, don't move, okay? I won't. Actually... I can't feel my legs. What? I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs. In this week of Thanksgiving there is much for which we can be grateful as we look back to where we stood only four weeks ago. The unity of this hemisphere, the support of our allies and the calm determination of the American people. These qualities may be tested many more times in this decade. So, how many students do you think you'll have here once you get the academy up and running? As many as I can manage. Possibly more. You know, one day the government is going to realize how lucky they were to have Professor x on their side. I suppose I am a real Professor now, aren't I? Next thing you know, I'll be going bald. We're still on the government's side, moira. We're still g-men. Just without the \"g\". No. You're your own team now. It's better. You're X-Men. Yes, I like the sound of that. Moira? For us, anonymity will be the first line of defense. I know. They can threaten me all they want, Charles. I'll never tell them where you are. Ever. I know you won't. I know. I remember the attack on hq, leaving to go somewhere else. And then this morning, I woke up at home. That's it. All that time, wiped clean from your mind. Just gone. He can do that? You don't remember anything? Sometimes I get fragments. Like trees, sunlight. A kiss. Oh, Jesus. Gentlemen, this is why the CIA is no place for a woman. What the hell was that? I know we've had our differences. Where's your telepath friend? Gone. Left a bit of a gap in my life, if I'm to be honest. I was rather hoping you would fill it. Join us. Erik, I believe.

Professor Xavier, Wolverine, Magneto, Storm, Kitty Pryde and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask. Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. . However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel. Will he succeed in stopping Mystique and the Sentinel Program and save the mutants and their human friends from annihilation?", "content": "(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA) PROFESSOR X: The future. A dark, desolate world. (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA CONTINUES) PROFESSOR X: A world of war, suffering, loss... on both sides. (WOMAN SOBBING) Mutants and the humans who dared to help them. (SOBBING CONTINUES) Fighting an enemy we cannot defeat. (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA) (PANTING) PROFESSOR X: Are we destined down this path? Destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us? (EXHALES DEEPLY) Or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves? Change our fate? (DISTANT GROWLING) Is the future truly set? (MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (WHIRRING) (MUFFLED THUMPING) They're here! (PANTING) Time's up. WARPATH: Sentinels! Sunspot! KITTY: Let's go. (PANTING) (MACHINERY WHIRRING) (GRUNTING) (GROWLING) (YELLING) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (PANTING) WARPATH: Run! (GRUNTING) BLINK: Go!

No! (MOANS) (PANTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ROARING) (YELLS) (GROWLS) (ROARING) Too late, assholes. (MAN SOBBING) Don't move, you mutant scum! (WOMAN SCREAMING) No! Flat on the ground, hands behind your head! (MAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN SOBBING) PROFESSOR X: So few of us left. KITTY: Professor? I've found them. (POWERING UP) (LIGHTER CLICKS) BOBBY: Professor! Bobby. Hey, Storm. Hey, kid. KITTY: Professor, you made it. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Whenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them... then I send Bishop back to warn us of the attack before it happens. Blink scouts the next site... and then we leave before they ever know we were there. Because... we never were. What do you mean you were never there? She projects Bishop back in time a few days to warn the others... of the coming attack. So she sends Bishop back in time? No, just his consciousness, into his younger self. His younger body. Wow. This might just work, Charles. What might work? The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask. In the early '70s, he was one of the world's leading weapons designers. But, covertly, he had begun experimenting on mutants... using their gifts to fuel his own research. TRASK: This is extraordinary. PROFESSOR X: There was one mutant who had discovered what he was doing. A mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone. Mystique. PROFESSOR X: I knew her as Raven. We met when we were children, grew up together. She was like a sister to me. I tried to help her... but only succeeded in driving her away. She hunted Trask across the world. And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973, after the Vietnam War... she found Trask... and killed him. (GUNSHOT) It was the first time she killed. It wasn't her last. But killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected. It only persuaded the government of the need for his program. (GASPS) PROFESSOR X: They captured her that day... tortured her, experimented on her. In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. It gave them the key they needed... to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power. And in less than 50 years... the machines that have destroyed... so many of our kind were created. (LOW GROWL) But it all started that day in 1973... the day she first killed. The day she truly became... Mystique. You want to go back there. If I can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out of their hands... then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born. And end this war before it ever begins. Uh, I can send someone back a couple weeks. Maybe a month. But you're talking about going back decades. You have the most powerful brain in the world, Professor... but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. It would rip you apart. I'm sorry. No one could survive that trip. What if someone's mind has a way of snapping back? What if someone can heal as fast as they're ripped apart? It's a risk. Yeah, I'm getting that. BISHOP: Not just for you. You do this, you change history. Well, that's kind of the point. Some of us could be killed. Some of us may never be born. We have no idea how things may change. BLINK: We could keep going. Keep fighting. STORM: Until what? You've got a decision to make. You can keep sending Bishop back in time over and over again to warn you, until one day, he doesn't make it, and you all die. Or you can give up this life. So that they and everyone else who died in this war can actually have a future. You're asking us to sacrifice our lives for a future we might not even be a part of. Yes. PROFESSOR X: A second chance. A better chance for everyone. My people need to vote. They just did. They're in. STORM: Okay, spread out. BISHOP: Take your positions. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) So I wake up in my younger body, God knows where. Then what? You'll need to go to my house and find me. Convince me of all of this. Won't you be able to just read my mind? I didn't have my powers in 1973. Logan, you're going to have to do for me what I once did for you. Lead me, guide me. I was a very different man then. You'll have to be patient with me. (CHUCKLES) Patience is my strongest suit. You'll need me as well. What? MAGNETO: After Mystique left Charles, she came with me... and I set her on a dangerous path. A darker path. It's going to take the two of us, side by side... at a time when we couldn't be further apart. Great. So where do I find you? Well, it's complicated. Are you sure about this? It's not just his power that'll be tested. I've seen what this can do to you. I can handle this. Trust me. I guess I'll see you in the next life. (CHUCKLES) KITTY: Basically, your body will go to sleep while your mind travels back in time. As long as you're back there, past and present will continue to coexist. But once you wake up... whatever you've done will take hold and become history. And for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know. It will be like the last 50 years never happened. And this world, and this war... the only person who will remember it is you. All right, Logan... I need you to clear your head and to stay as calm as possible. What? What do you mean? If your mind gets rocky, it will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip between past and future. What if I need to get a little rocky? Think peaceful thoughts? Peaceful thoughts... Do you have any good news? Well, you don't really age, so you'll pretty much look the same. BOBBY: You won't have much time in the past. The Sentinels will find us. They always do. And this time, we won't be able to run. We'll have no escape. This is our last chance. You really think this will work? I have faith in him. MAGNETO: It's not him I'm worried about, it's us. We were young... we didn't know any better. We will now. See you all soon. This might sting a little.

(ENGINE TURNS OVER) (MAN SPEAKING OVER RADIO) (EXHALES) Hmm. MAN: (OVER RADIO) Today, the 18th MP Brigade is departing from Saigon, marking the last American troops to leave Vietnam. And effectively ending the war. SENATOR BRICKMAN: We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures... and all the black books are being opened. We can't support a weapon that targets our own citizens. If these mutants, as you describe... are already living among us... then they are living here peacefully. PARKER: We haven't had an incident in over 10 years. After what happened in Cuba? PARKER: That was never confirmed. We have very real enemies out there... the Russians, the Chinese. We are talking about a tenth of a tenth... of a tenth of our population. Allow me to read something to you. Please. This was acquired by our friends at the CIA. It's a dissertation... written by a mutant at Oxford University. And I quote... \"To Homo Neanderthalensis... \"his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens...\" which is us... \"was an aberration. \"The arrival of the mutated human species, Homo Sapiens... \"was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.\" Well... Now, we are the Neanderthal. Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask. (ALL LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) You know, when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam... without the weapons they needed to win the war... you underestimated your enemy. (CHUCKLING) You do that with this enemy... Mmm... and it won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our streets... our cities, our homes... and by the time you see the need for my program... it will be too late... and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime. We are sorry, Dr. Trask... but your Sentinel Program... it ain't gonna fly. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Can I help you, Colonel? Just here to give our boys a proper send-off. I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders. This is a quarantined area. Stand aside, soldier. That's an order. SOLDIER: Atten-hut! At ease. (CLEARS THROAT) What is all this? Lab reports, blood tests. It's all getting packed up and shipped back. Where is it going? Same place they are. Trask Industries. STRYKER: Let's go, gentlemen. I'm taking you out of this shit show. HAVOK: Shipping home? Not just yet. What are you doing with those? Something to make the ride a little smoother. I'm transferring you to a private facility... where we can run a few more tests. (COLONEL SANDERS CLEARS THROAT) Your men are not military. Private outfit. We're authorized to remand these men. Hmm. These troops are going home. Well, Colonel, I don't believe you have jurisdiction in this matter. I'm afraid I do, son. I'm sorry, who are you? The question is, Major... who are you? (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (CHOKING) Raven! That's not my name. (GRUNTING) (EXHALES SHARPLY) I had that. I know. Let's move out. Come on, let's go. HAVOK: Where's Erik? I'm on my own now. Let's go! Move it! (SOLDIERS YELLING INDISTINCTLY) Hold that plane! Wouldn't wanna leave these boys in this godforsaken country. SOLDIER: Yes, sir. You're not coming with us, are you? My war's not over. The enemy is still out there. The four privates, where did they go? They were headed towards the tarmac. Can I help you? Uh... Yeah, what happened to the school? The school's been shut for years. Are you a parent? (SCOFFS) I sure as hell hope not. Who are you? I'm Hank. Hank McCoy. I look after the house now. You're Beast? Look at you. I guess you're a late bloomer. I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. (GRUNTS) So where's the Professor? There's no professor here. You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid. You sure there's not a little Beast in there? No, he's not here. Come on, Beast. Come on, Beastie. No. (GRUNTS) Hey! I said the school's closed. You need to leave. Not until I see the Professor. There's no professor here, I told you that. Look, kid. You and I are gonna be good friends. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) You just don't know it yet. (GROANS) Professor! (GROANS) (GRUNTS) Professor! (ROARS) (GRUNTS) (HANK ROARS) (LOGAN SCREAMING) (ROARS) CHARLES: Hank? What's going on here? Professor? Please don't call me that. Why? You know this guy? Yeah, he looks slightly familiar. Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank. (GLASS CLINKING) You can walk. You're a perceptive one. I thought Erik... Which makes it slightly perplexing that you missed our sign on the way in. This is private property, my friend. I'm gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave. Well. (SIGHS) I'm afraid I can't do that... because, uh, I was sent here for you. Tell whoever it was that sent you that I'm busy. That's gonna be a little tricky... because the person who sent me was you. What? About 50 years from now. (LAUGHING) I know. Stay with me. Like in the future, 50 years from now? Yeah. I sent you from the future? Yeah. CHARLES: Piss off. If you had your powers, you'd know I was telling the truth. How do you know I don't have my p... Who are you? LOGAN: I told you. Are you CIA? No. You've been watching me? I know you, Charles. We've been friends for years. I know your powers came when you were 9. I know you thought you were going crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. And it wasn't until you were 12... that you realized all the voices were in everyone else's head. Do you want me to go on? I never told anyone that. Not yet, no, but, you will. All right, you've piqued my interest. What do you want? We have to stop Raven. I need your help. We need your help. I think I'd like to wake up now. (SIGHS) What does she have to do with this? CHARLES: So you're saying... they took Raven's power, and what? They weaponized it? Yep. She is unique. Yeah, she is, Hank. LOGAN: In the beginning, the Sentinels were just targeting mutants. Then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants... who would eventually have mutant children and grandchildren. Many of the humans tried to help us, but it was a slaughter. Leaving only the worst of humanity in charge. I've been in a lot of wars. I'd never seen anything like this. And it all starts with her. Let's just say for the sake of... the sake, that I choose to believe you... that I choose to help you. Raven won't listen to me. (SIGHS) Her heart and soul belong to someone else now. LOGAN: I know. That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too. HANK: Erik? (LAUGHING) You do know where he is? LOGAN: Yeah. (CHARLES LAUGHING) CHARLES: Could you give me that one more time, please? You heard me. (LAUGHING) He's where he belongs. You're just gonna walk out? Ooh, top marks. Like I said, you are perceptive. The Professor I know would never turn his back... on someone who'd lost their path. Especially someone he loved. You know... I think I do remember you now. Yeah. Tall, angry fellow with the contentious hair. We came to you a long time ago... seeking your help. And I'm gonna say to you what you said to us then. Fuck off. Listen to me, you little shit. I've come a long way, and I've watched a lot of people die. Good people. Friends. If you're gonna wallow in self-pity... and do nothing, then you're gonna watch the same thing... you understand? We all have to die sometime. Told you there was no professor here. What the hell happened to him? HANK: He lost everything. Erik, Raven... his legs. (SIGHS) We built the school, the labs, this whole place... then, just after the first semester... the war in Vietnam got worse. Many of the teachers... and older students were drafted. It broke him. He retreated into himself. I wanted to help, do something... so I designed a serum to treat his spine... derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. (SIGHS) I take just enough to keep myself balanced... but he takes too much. I tried easing him back... but he just couldn't bear the pain, the voices. The treatment gives him his legs... but it's not enough. He's... He's just lost too much. (SIGHS) YOUNG RAVEN: You're not scared of me? YOUNG CHARLES: I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. Charles Xavier. Raven. You're hungry and alone. Take whatever you want. We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal. In fact... you never have to steal again. And that's a promise. CHARLES: I'll help you get her. Not for any of your future shite, but for her. Fair enough. But I'll tell you this. You don't know Erik. That man is a monster. A murderer. You think you can convince Raven to change? To come home? That's splendid. But what makes you think you can change him? Because you and Erik sent me back here together. HANK: The room they're holding him in was built during the Second World War... when there was a shortage of steel. So the foundation is pure concrete and sand. No metal. CHARLES: He's being held... a hundred floors beneath the most heavily guarded building on the planet. LOGAN: Why is he in there? What, he forgot to mention? (SNICKERING) Uh, JFK. He killed... (CHUCKLING) What else explains a bullet miraculously curving through the air? Erik's always had a way with guns. Are you sure you want to carry on with this? This is your plan, not mine. HANK: We don't have any resources to get us in. CHARLES: Or out. It's just me and Hank. I knew a guy. Yeah, he'd be a young man now. Grew up outside of D.C. (CHUCKLING) He could get into anywhere. I just don't know how the hell we're gonna find him. Is Cerebro out of the question? LOGAN: If only you guys had Internet. What's \"Internet?\" (SIGHS) We have a phone book. I thought you'd be getting ready for your trip, sir. I just came to grab a couple files. Is that a new scarf? It's nice. Thank you. (BEEPS) (BREATH TREMBLING) (GASPS) Dr. Trask? One second. Oh. We added some names to the Paris meeting. Thank you. Is something wrong, sir? No. It's nothing. Would you mind typing up my itinerary? I don't wanna miss anything. LOGAN: Here, here, here. CHARLES: Where? Just stop here. All right, all right. LOGAN: Next time I'm driving. Don't get used to it. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (MAN TALKING ON TV) (SIGHS) What's he done now? I will just write you a check for whatever he took. We just need to talk to him. Peter! The cops are here. Again. (DOOR CLOSES) I'm a princess. What are you? I'm the Wolverine. Where's your brother? Go upstairs and bug your sister. But she bugs me! (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (PLAYING PING-PONG) PETER: What do you guys want? I didn't do anything. I've been here all day. Just relax, Peter. We're not cops. Of course you're not. If you were, you wouldn't be driving a rental car. How did you know we've got a rental car? I checked your registration when you were walking to the door. I also had some time to kill so I went through your rental agreement. Saw you were from out of town. Are you FBI? No, you're not cops. Hey, what's with this gifted youngsters place? That's an old card. He's fascinating. He's a pain in the arse. What, a teleporter? No, he's just fast. And when I knew him he wasn't so... young. PETER: Young? You're just old. So you're not afraid to show your powers? What powers? What are you talking about? Do you see something strange here? Nothing anybody would believe if you told them. (ARCADE GAME PINGING) So, who are you? What do you want? LOGAN: We need your help, Peter. For what? To break into a highly secured facility... and to get someone out. Prison break? That's illegal, you know. Um... Well, only if you get caught. So, what's in it for me? You, you kleptomaniac, get to break into the Pentagon. How do I know I can trust you? Because we're just like you. Show him. (BREATHES DEEPLY) That's cool, but it's disgusting. TOUR GUIDE: Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the world's largest office building... housing more than 25,000 military employees... stretched over six million square feet. Where's the bathroom? GIRL: He always needs to pee! (ALL LAUGH) (STATIC CRACKLES) (DOOR BUZZING) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Yeah, we're getting broadcast signal down here. What's going on? Damn it, call Maintenance, get them down here. (CHUCKLES) (SHOES SQUEAKING) (VIBRATING) (RUMBLING) (ALARM BLARING) fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire. Now, this month-long battle... included some of the fiercest fighting during World War II in the Pacific... (CHEF SPEAKING FRENCH) (ALARM BLARING) (GRUNTS) ERIK: In three seconds, those doors are going to open... and 20 guards will be here to shoot us. I know. That's what I'm waiting for. What are you doing? I'm holding your neck so you don't get whiplash. What? (SLOWLY) Whiplash. GUARD: Don't move! (GRUNTS) (ALL GROAN) (EXHALES SHARPLY) PETER: You're good, it'll pass. It happens with everyone. You must have done something pretty serious. What did you do, man? What did you do? What did you do? Why'd they have you in there? For killing the President. Ah. Wow. (WHISPERS) Shit. The only thing I'm guilty of is fighting for people like us. You take karate? You know karate, man? I don't know karate. But I know crazy. (CHUCKLES) Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is a Code Red situation. We are evacuating the entire floor... so that my associate and I... can, uh, secure the prison. Who are you? We're special operations, CB... FB-CID. Perhaps you didn't hear me when first I spoke... but it is imperative that you understand... we're in a complete lockdown situation. We have to get you to the third floor... (GRUNTS) Oh, I'm sorry. Were you finished? (GRUNTING) They told me you control metal. \"They\"? (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) You know, my mom once knew a guy who could do that. I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with violence. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Charles? (GRUNTS) (CHARLES GROANS) Good to see you too, old friend. And walking. No thanks to you. You're the last person in the world I expected to see today. Believe me... I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to. If we get you out of here, we do it my way. No killing. No helmet. I couldn't disobey you even if I wanted. I'm never getting inside of that head again. I need your word, Erik. Nobody move! Hold it right there! Charles. GUARD: Don't move. Hands up, or we will shoot! Freeze them, Charles. I can't. Hands up! (CLATTERING) No!

CHARLES: Peter, thank you very, very much. You take care. PETER: Hey, I saw your flight plan in the cockpit. Why are you going to Paris? Imagine if they were metal. CHARLES: Do me a favor and return it for me. Okay. And, Peter? Take it slow. (CHUCKLES) Where did they dig you up? You're gonna find this hard to believe... but, uh, you sent me. You and Charles. From the future. (SIGHS) How did you lose them? The treatment for my spine affects my DNA. You sacrificed your powers so you could walk? I sacrificed my powers so that I could sleep. What do you know about it? I've lost my fair share. Ha. Dry your eyes, Erik. It doesn't justify what you've done. You have no idea what I've done. I know that you took the things that mean the most to me. Well, maybe you should have fought harder for them. If you want a fight, Erik... LOGAN: Sit down. I will give you a fight! Let him come. You abandoned me! You took her away... and you abandoned me! Angel. Azazel. Emma. Banshee. Mutant brothers and sisters... all dead! (GRUNTS) Countless others... experimented on. Butchered! Erik! Where were you, Charles? We were supposed to protect them! Where were you when your own people needed you? Hiding! You and Hank! Pretending to be something you're not! Erik! You abandoned us all. (SIGHING) (PANTING) So, you were always an asshole. (SCOFFS) I take it we're best buddies in the future. (CHUCKLES) I spent a lot of years trying to bring you down, bub. How does that work out for you? You're like me. You're a survivor. Do you wanna pick all that shit up? (FRENCH DISCO MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL LAUGHING) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) General, maybe you should slow down, we have a big day tomorrow. We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win a war, let alone against the American devils. I'm getting another bottle. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Excuse me. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) I'm pretty sure it was my fault. You speak Vietnamese. I'm an interpreter. I speak many tongues. Let me buy you another drink... unless you're here with someone. I'm alone. (SPEAKING FRENCH) A bottle of Johnnie Walker please. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) You're going to the Summit tomorrow? A pretty girl interested in politics... Looks can be deceiving. Lady. Show me more, baby? Clothes off? What's the matter, baby? You don't think I look pretty like this? (GRUNTS) (GLASS SHATTERS) (CHOKING) (GASPING) (SQUEAKING) (GASPING) (SNORING) Fancy a game? It's been a while. I'm not in the mood for games, thank you. ERIK: I haven't had a real sip in ten years. (SIGHS) (SWALLOWS) I didn't kill the President. The bullet curved, Erik. Because I was trying to save him. They took me out before I could. Why would you try and save him? Because he was one of us. (SCOFFS) You must think me so foolish. We've always said they would come after us. I never imagined they'd use Raven's DNA to do it. When did you last see her? (CLICKS TONGUE) The day I left for Dallas. And how was she? Strong. Driven. Loyal. How... How was she? She was... We were... I could see why she meant so much to you. You should be proud of her, Charles. She's out there fighting for our cause. Your cause. The girl I raised was not capable of killing. You didn't raise her, you grew up with her. She couldn't stay a little girl forever, that's why she left. She left because you got inside her head. That's not my power. She made a choice. But now we know where that choice leads, don't we? She's going to murder Trask, they're going to capture her... and then they're going to wipe us out. Not if we get to her first. Not if we change history tomorrow. I'm sorry, Charles... for what happened. I truly am. It's been a while since I've played. (CLEARS THROAT) I'll go easy on you. Might finally be a fair fight. You have the first move. The diplomats from all around the world are arriving here today at the Hotel Royal. It's an historic day. It's the, uh, official ending of the United States' military involvement in Vietnam. There we have the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister... with other South Vietnamese dignitaries. The Summit doesn't begin for another hour. The hotel has arranged a private room upstairs for your special guests. TRASK: That will be plenty of time. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Good afternoon, everyone. Hello, thank you for coming. Congratulations on winning this war. Now, I know you all have hands to shake and photos to take downstairs... so I will get right to the point. There is a new enemy out there. An enemy that will render your arsenals useless... your armies powerless... and your nations defenseless. TRASK: You will need a new weapon for this war. I call them Sentinels. Named after the ancient guardians that stood at the gates of the citadel. (GRUNTS) They have the aeronautic capabilities of a Harrier jet. Armed with guns that can fire off... more than 2, 000 rounds per minute of thermoceramic ammunition. But size, power, speed... you could find that at Lockheed or Boeing. No, what makes the Sentinels so special... is the ability to target the mutant X-gene. A genetic guidance system that can lock onto a mark a half a mile away. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) It won't trigger unless it has identified the target. With this weapon, there will be no human collateral damage. If I turn it on, the system couldn't even activate in here. (BEEPING) Unless there's a mutant. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) There has to be some kind of mistake. My machines don't make mistakes. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) What are you? (MAN SPEAKS VIETNAMESE) I assure you... TRASK: No, don't shoot it. I assure you, I don't know what you're talking about. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (GRUNTING) ERIK: Raven! (GRUNTS) Raven? Raven! (SHUDDERING) Raven? (BEEPING) Charles? We've come for you, Erik and I. Together. RAVEN: I never thought I'd see you again. CHARLES: I made you a promise a long time ago that I would protect you. (GRUNTING) MAN: Wolverine! (GASPING) CHARLES: I'm going to keep you safe. I'm going to keep you out of their hands. Erik? Erik? What are you doing? Securing our future. Forgive me, Mystique. As long as you're out there, we'll never be safe. Erik... Use your power, Charles. Stop him. He can't. (CROWD GASPING) (GROANING) KITTY: He's slipping back. I'm losing him. (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (ALL GASPING) LOGAN: Stryker! STRYKER: Someone will finish what we've started, Wolverine! One day! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) Restrain him. (CROWD CLAMORING) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) Erik! Where am I? Huh? How the hell did I get here? What? You came to us. Who are you? Charles. Charles Xavier! I don't know you. Huh? What the hell is that? Whoa. Whoa. Look, I can deal with this. Just go. Stop Erik! Erik, please... I'm sorry. Erik... (CROWD SCREAMING) (GROANING) (CROWD SCREAMING) (GASPS) You're Logan, that's Hank McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier. You spent the last couple of days with us. You're on acid. Somebody gave you really bad acid, yeah? (RATTLING) (ALL SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Just hold on tight, we'll get through this together. (KITTY GROANS) Oh, my God, Kitty. She's wounded pretty bad. (GROANING) (CLAMORING) (ROARING) (KITTY WHIMPERING) I got him. (GASPS) Professor? What happened to you? I just saw someone who's gonna bring me a lot of pain someday. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) Where's Raven? Gone. What? We have to get out of here. We want to know if there's any sort of connection with... (ALL CLAMORING) Yesterday, the Paris Peace Summit... was rocked by the appearance of unidentified assailants... the likes of which the world has never seen. Mass hysteria has gripped the nation as people ask... \"Where did they come from? Will they be back?\" And most importantly, \"Are they friend or foe?\" That was London correspondent Toby Elliot... reporting from the Paris Peace Summit yesterday. Fuck me. What the hell are we dealing with here? Off the record. Two days ago, this man, Erik Lehnsherr... escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon. We believe that this woman is a former associate of Lehnsherr's. They were together in Cuba, the day of the crisis in '62. He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination. What about that thing? MAN: We don't know what that thing is, sir. Actually, we really don't know what any of them are. Yes. Yes, we do. They're mutants. He has the power to control metal. Last I checked, that's what most of your weapons were made of. And she can transform into anyone. A general, a secret serviceman. Even you, Mr. President. She could walk into this office... and order a nuclear strike if she was in the mood. And that's only two of them. Do we have any countermeasures? Any defense? I was waiting for you to ask me that question. That's an experimental program, sir. Strictly off the books. (DOG BARKS) You're telling me these mutants are out in the world... and our best defense are these giant metal robots? Many of the mutants look like us. My Sentinels can tell the difference. I have eight prototypes ready to go. They're built out of a space-age polymer, not an ounce of metal on them. I want to make a demonstration. I want the world to know that we can protect them. What do you need to get these things operational? I already gave that number to Congress. Unfortunately, they elected to shut me down. It's going to cost a bit more to turn them on. NIXON: Whatever you need. TRASK: Oh, and one more thing. If we do manage to capture them, I would like her. For research purposes, of course. I don't care who you screw, as long as it's not me. (NEWSREADER SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Terrible thing. What is? Being born like that. Is it? Can you imagine... Looking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you? Yes, I can. Where do you think she comes from? You think she has a family? Yes. She does. (NEWSREADER SPEAKING FRENCH ON TV) (BEGGING IN FRENCH) If I see so much as a screw move, I will jam this into your throat. How did you find me? You taught me well. It's been a long time since we were this close. I missed you. You tried to kill me. So the rest of us could live. What do you mean? We received a message from the future. Don't lie to me. I never have, and I never will. Humans use your blood, your genes, to create a weapon that wipes us all out. I was only doing what I thought necessary to secure our future. So what's to stop me from killing you right now and securing my future? Nothing. It doesn't matter anymore. They have your DNA. Your blood was on the street. Whose fault was that? Mine. I've seen their plans. They're creating a weapon. And now they have what they need to take it further. We have to strike now, while we still hold the upper hand. I've seen too many friends die, Erik. I don't want a war. I only want the man who murdered them. This is war. What happened to you? Did you lose your way while I was gone? Are you still Charles' Raven? Or are you Mystique? Trask is the enemy. Killing one man isn't enough. It never was for you. Goodbye, Erik. (GRUNTING) LOGAN: What happened? Come on. Can he walk? He needs his treatment. Hank, I can hear them. I know. It's okay. Can you make it stop? I'll get them. (GROANS) LOGAN: Hey, hey. Pull yourself together. It's not over yet. (PANTING) You don't believe that. How do you know? CHARLES: As these go... this comes back. They all come back. Look. I'm still here... and she's still out there. We need your help, Charles. Not like this. I need you. We can't find Raven. Not without your powers. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) HANK: I added a little extra because you missed a dose. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Charles. (IN HALES SHARPLY) Hank, do me a favor. Would you help me to my study, please? Come on, I got you. (CHARLES GRUNTS) Are you sure about this? Absolutely not. TRASK: This creature is extraordinary. Her genes could hold the key to mutation itself. I need more. That's all they were able to scrape off the pavement in Paris. More than blood. I need brain tissue... spinal fluid, bone marrow. Imagine... Sentinels that could transform, adapt to any target. If I could just get my hands on her. This girl could leap the program forward years... decades into the future. How old is your son now, Major? Jason? He's coming up on ten now, if you can believe it. Eight years from fighting age. And how many of our sons and brothers did we just ship home in body bags? Maybe fifty, fifty-five thousand? And how many more on the other side? Never before... in all of human history... has there been a cause which could unite us as a species. Until now. You really hate, mutants, don't you? On the contrary, I rather admire them. The things they can do. I see mutants as our salvation. A common enemy. A common struggle against the ultimate enemy. Extinction. I believe our new friends... are going to help us usher in a new era, Bill. A new era of genuine... and long-lasting peace. MAN OVER PA: Attention, attention. Transport departure in two hours. Repeat. Transport departure in two hours. (SIGHS) When was the last time you were down here? The last time we went looking for students. A lifetime ago. (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Welcome, Professor. (SIGHING) HANK: Raven's wounded. She won't be moving fast. (BLOWS) These are muscles I haven't stretched in a long time. (GASPS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (WEEPING AND YELLING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES) (GROANING) Charles! Charles! (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Charles? It's all right. (PANTING) I'll go check the generator. It's not the machinery, is it? I can't do this. My mind... Yes, you can. (STAMMERING) It won't take it. You're just a little rusty. You don't understand. It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs. But my power comes from here. It comes from... And it's broken. I feel like one of my students. Helpless. It was a mistake coming down here. It was a mistake freeing Erik. This whole thing has been one bloody mistake. I'm sorry, Logan, but they sent back the wrong man. You're right. I am. Actually, it was supposed to be you. But I was the only one who could physically make the trip. And, uh... And I don't know how long I've got here. But I do know that a long time ago... actually, a long time from now... I was your most helpless student. And you unlocked my mind. You showed me what I was. You showed me what I could be. I don't know how to do that for you. You're right. I don't. But I know someone who might. Hmm. Look into my mind. You saw what I did to Cerebro. You don't want me inside your head. There's no damage you can do... that hasn't already been done. Trust me. Come on. (SCREAMING) Hey. (SCREAMING) Hey, Logan. Hi, Jean. Kill me. I love you. (GROANS) (SCREAMING) You poor, poor man. Look past me. No, I don't want your suffering. I don't want your future! Look past my future. Look for your future. That's it. That's it. That's it. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT TALKING) Charles. Charles. (CHUCKLES) So this is what becomes of us. Erik was right. Humanity does this to us. Not if we show them a better path. You still believe? Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... it doesn't mean they're lost forever. Sometimes we all need a little help. Oh, I'm not the man I was. I open my mind... and it almost overwhelms me. You're afraid, and Cerebro knows it. All those voices... so much pain. It's not their pain you're afraid of. It's yours, Charles. And as frightening as it may be... that pain will make you stronger. If you allow yourself to feel it... embrace it... it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined. It's the greatest gift we have... to bear their pain without breaking. And it's born... from the most human power. Hope. Please, Charles... we need you to hope again. Find what you were looking for? HANK: The power's back on. Yes. Yes, it is. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (GRUNTS) (METAL CLANKING) (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WIND HOWLING) (MOANING) BOBBY: She's lost too much blood. She can't keep going like this. We have no choice, Bobby. We can wake him up. No! They need more time. I had... a glimpse into the past. If we wake Logan now... we may set our fate on an even darker course. They need more time. There is someone else. No, no one has Kitty's power. Someone that could take her power, take her place. She took yours once. Rogue. I'm sorry, Bobby, she must be dead. I haven't been able to make a connection with her for years. That's because they're keeping her in the one place your mind can't reach from the outside. She's in Cerebro. She's in your house, Professor. They're experimenting on her. Trying to tap into her power, so they can take ours. Take all of ours. If you knew this, why didn't you go after her? We tried. It's too heavily guarded. I may know a few things about that house they don't. BOBBY: Kitty, I'm going to get help. I'm gonna bring back somebody to help you. Please, just bring yourself back. (WOMAN ANNOUNCING IN FRENCH OVER PA) Raven, stop. Stop running. Charles? Where are you? Back at the house... where you should be. I need you to come home. I know what I need to do. If you kill Trask... you will be creating countless more just like him. Then I'll kill them, too. Those are Erik's words, not yours. Oh! The girl I grew up with wasn't capable of killing. She was good... fair, full of compassion. I have compassion. Just not for Trask. He's murdered too many of us. Shut her down, Charles. Get in her head. CHARLES: She's not letting me in. I'm barely holding on. I'm not strong enough yet. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GASPS) I know what Trask has done... but killing him will not bring them back. It will set you on a path... from which there is no return. An endless cycle of killing. Us and them, until there is nothing left. But we can stop it, right now, you and I. You just have to come home. I have to? You haven't changed at all, Charles. Like I said... I know exactly what I have to do. You do? Then, wherever you go, I will find you. And, Raven, if you make me, I will stop you. Good luck, Charles. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Where is she? (CHUCKLES) She's in an airport, boarding a plane. She could be going anywhere. (SIGHS) LOGAN: Get some rest, Charles. We'll track her in the morning and find out exactly where she's going. MAN ON TV: Rockets did land outside the base, killing five civilians and wounding 12 others. (KNOCKING) Yeah? You know that those things can give you cancer? I've done some toxicology tests in the lab, and... You want something? Yeah, I'm... I know it's complicated, and there's probably all kinds of rules and reasons for what you can and can't say, but I was wondering if you could tell me in the future, do I make it? No. Oh. Okay. It's okay. Thanks. Hey, kid? It's just the world I came from. We're going backwards in time. Tomorrow, in front of the White House, the President will make his announcement. He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... and has even sought the help of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask... his special advisor to combat this mutant issue. (THUD) The White House has asked all three networks to air the event live, as it is a matter of importance not only to the United States, but to every citizen from around the globe. There are no other details about the event... Raven... My God. I don't understand. What are you doing here? I, uh... I guess, I just realized I have nowhere else to go. I've gotta wake Charles... No, don't. Just wait. You really shouldn't walk on this. I've had worse. So, you've been living here all these years? Someone had to take care of Charles. You know, he's missed you. He misses who I was. I'm not who he wants me to be anymore. I've missed you. So, you're like this all the time now. Like what? This. No, not all the time. I take a shot in the morning, and I need another if I get worked up. Worked up? Yeah, yeah, when I'm... emotional or excited. Any animal urges. Hmm. Usually, I can fight them off. Well, maybe, we shouldn't have to fight off the things that come naturally to us. (GROWLING) Do you remember one of the last things you said to me? That I would never be deemed beautiful, looking like this? Do you still think that? Maybe. You saw what happened in Paris. You know what they think of us. What do you think? I think you're beautiful. What about yourself? You should get some rest. I'm glad you're home. Hank? Do you remember the last thing I said to you? It was, \"Mutant and proud.\" (SIGHS) PROFESSOR X: The old gas and water pipes lead straight to the house. The walls are made of reinforced steel. In other words, a door. (CREAKING) PROFESSOR X: You're walking directly over the hall now. (CLANKING) (HISSING) I've been on that slab. Let me show you how it feels. Rogue, Rogue, come on. Wake up. BOBBY: Rogue. Come on, Rogue, wake up. Wake up, it's me. No. (GROANING) (IN HALES SHARPLY) (PANTING) (ROGUE MOANS) Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, it's okay. He's with me. We're gonna get you out of here. PROFESSOR X: Erik, Bobby. Get out of there! Now! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Take her! Bobby! No! Bobby! (STRAINING) (SCREAMS) ROGUE: Bobby! (EXPLOSION) Professor! Get us out of here. Bobby. I know. (ENGINES WHIRRING) (SCREAMS) (ROARING) (THUDDING) I'm sorry, Charles. Where's Bobby? I'm sorry, Kitty. (SOBBING) (GASPS) Hello, Logan. (GASPS) Rogue. (DOOR OPENS) Raven was here. I screwed up. Shit. We can't track her now. She's cut her ties. Hey, I saw in the news last night there's going to be an announcement in Washington this afternoon about a new protocol for mutants. I set the system I designed... to record any news about Paris over all three networks... and PBS. All three? Wow. Yeah, and PBS. Look what I found. Tomorrow, in front of the White House, the President will make his announcement. He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... and has even sought the help of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask... his special advisor to combat this mutant issue. The White House has asked... CHARLES: Raven doesn't realize... that if she kills Trask at an event like that... with the whole world watching... Then I came a long way for nothing. And there's more bad news. I saw in a report... they found traces of her blood in Paris. For all we know, they already have her DNA... which is all they'd need. To create the Sentinels of the future. There's a theory in quantum physics... that time is immutable. It's like a river. You can throw a pebble into it... and create a ripple, but the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do, the river just keeps flowing in the same direction. What are you trying to say? What I'm saying is... what if the war is inevitable? What if she's meant to kill Trask? What if this is just simply who she is? Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... doesn't mean they're lost forever. No, I don't believe that theory, Hank. And I cannot believe that is who she is. CHARLES: Ready the plane. We're going to Washington. (BEEPING) You all right? Getting there. (SIGHS) Whatever happens today, I need you to promise me something. You've looked into my mind and seen a lot of bad... but you've seen the good, too. The X-Men. Promise me you'll find us.

And anyone who stands in our way... will suffer the same fate as these men... you see before you. Today was meant to be a display of your power.

You want to make a statement? Kill me. Fine. But spare everyone else. (GRUNTING) Very heroic, Mr. President... but you had no intention... of sparing any of us. The future of our species begins now. (GUNS COCKING) (BEEPING) (GASPING) You used to be a better shot. Trust me, I still am. Get out of my head, Charles! Raven. Please, do not make us the enemy today. Look around you. We already are. (BREATHING HEAVILY) CHARLES: Not all of us. All you've done so far... is save the lives of these men. You can show them a better path. Shut her down, Charles. I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met... and look where that's got us. Everything that happens now... is in your hands. (BREATHING DEEPLY) I have faith in you, Raven. (EXHALES) RAVEN: He's all yours, Charles. (GRUNTS) If you let them have me, I'm as good as dead. You know that. I know. Goodbye, old friend. Goodbye, Erik.

Welcome. Heave-ho! Welcome to Ashikari Village Thank you for coming from so far. Even though it's this deep in the mountains, it's such a nice inn. The whole village got together and built it to welcome our guests. The whole village? For generations, they have been woodcutters. About how many people are living here in this village? Excuse me? Yes? That's why. So the ones left are only old folks like myself. Keiichi Asamiya I will leave the yukatas over here. May I serve dinner after your bath? Yes. The hot spring is very relaxing. Please clean your legs very well. We came to some place, huh? The place doesn't really matter. As long as it's far away from him. Is it really over now? Can't you let go of him cheating once? You wouldn't understand, Aiko. Understand what? It's because you've never cried over someone before. You've gone out with so many people. I don't want you to understand how I feel. He was my first boyfriend... So what? I'm going to go back to the room. Hello? It's me. Shiyori got out of the bath just now, so... Yeah, everything is as planned. Shiyori, I want to talk one more time. Please answer. - Keiichi Wait, Shiyori! Shiyori! Hello? Why... won't... you... answ... Get out of there! U-Um, excuse me... Leg... chopped...

The room lights all of a sudden... Really... They finally... Who do you mean by \"they\"? Who are you? What's the meaning of this? Miss, were you able to clean your legs very well? Regarding the power outage, please don't worry. We will come by right away, so... It's okay. I'm going to bed now. I'll be sacrificed? What do you mean by that? Even if I talk to you about this, I don't know if you'll believe it... Please just tell me. I'm Akira Mononobe. I'm studying ethnology at Jounan University. Ethnology? Yeah. In ancient Japan, there was a custom to sacrifice young women to the gods in order to ward off catastrophes. In Ashikari Village too, where you are... From the beginning, Ashikari was a village of woodcutters. While the men were away chopping trees from mountain to mountain, in order to make sure the women didn't run off, the men chopped off the women's left legs. That was the start of the horrible custom. As time went on, the villagers captured traveling women and worshipped them as living gods to offer to the mountain. The women that were turned into living gods had their left legs cut off and were imprisoned in a small mountain shrine. As for that custom, it's being quietly practiced to this day. All the villagers were dragging their legs, right? When children are born, they cut the tendons in their left legs. As proof of association, but also to keep them from escaping the village. Impossible! I can understand how you don't want to believe it. But you must've seen it too. The scarecrows posted all over the village... Those aren't decorations. They mummified the women who died and worship them as guardians of the village. Be careful. The ritual has already started. We've brought you some lights. Dark places are dangerous. Please open the door, miss. What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Hello? Hello? Hello... Please tell me your name. It's Shiyori Mizuno... Shiyori... I want to help you. You can believe my story or get your leg chopped off by them. You only have one of those two choices! Hello? Hello? Mr. Mononobe! Please hold on! Is there something wrong? If you're not going to open it, I'll use my key and come in! Why aren't you answering, Aiko? It's an emergency. Contact me as soon as possible. - Shiyori Out of range Please, Aiko, answer... Please... Receiving... Crisis! I'm waiting at the restroom at the hot spring. - Aiko Akira Mononobe Mr. Mononobe? What's the situation? I managed to get out of the inn area. Did you bring the map of the village? Did you bring the map of the village? Yes... The main entrances and exits are most likely already covered. It's a little far, but there's an old tunnel towards the east end. Please wait for me there. I'm heading there with my car right now. I understand. By the way, I want to ask you something important. How did you find out about Ashikari Village? From a friend in the same club... Her name is Aiko... She invited me to go to a hot spring with her... I have to go save Aiko... How did she find out about Ashikari Village? She said she looked it up online... It's dangerous... As far as I researched, there is no information about Ashikari Village on the Web. That can't be... Then Aiko is... She might be working with them too. Hello? Listen, Shiyori. It's important for you to stay alive and get out of that village. If you want to stay alive, regardless of what happens, don't believe anyone. Hello? Hello? To Hot Spring (Restroom) To Old Tunnel Aiko... Please... Please answer, Aiko. Please... Hello? Hello, Aiko? I'm so glad you're okay. I was seriously worried about you! Shiyori? What's up with this cell phone number? I'll explain later! More importantly, where are you right now? A restroom... I'm at the restroom right now. It's a restroom all right, but not that restroom. Regardless, watch out for the villagers. This village is seriously bad news. Hey, Aiko... What? Aiko, you're not trying to deceive me, right? What are you talking about? I can really believe you, right? Hey, please answer... you anything? %> Um, Shiyori... To be honest... Hello, Aiko? Aiko? Hey, what's wrong? Hello? Aiko? Hello? Yayoi? Huh? Shiyori? I'm so glad I got a hold of you... I don't have any other friend I can talk to... Please help me... What's the matter? Ashikari Village There are no matching pages. There are no matching pages. What that Mononobe guy said is true, What that Mononobe guy said is true, but there is no basis on which to believe him either. The cell phone you're using now... You don't really know if that girl named Shizuka actually exists or not. But... Anyway, I'll contact the police. I'll look into that guy named Mononobe too. Thank you. Also, it's kind of hard to say this, but you should watch out for Aiko too. What do you mean? I'm not too fond of her... To tell you honestly, I don't really trust her. Shiyori, you;re too nice. I'm sure there are times when you're betrayed, but just believe in yourself and do your best. I actually want to go save you, but with my body the way it is now... I'm sorry. Don't be. To Aiko. I'll be waiting at the east tunnel. - Shiyori Sending Sent Your other leg is so beautiful... No! No! Aiko, you're not trying to deceive me, right? I can really believe you, right?

Shiyori Mizuno Final Chapter: The Pair's Cell Phones at X Cross Akira Mononobe Hey, Shiyori, please listen... The one who set up our breakup was actually Aiko. Apparently, there was a girl from work who had feelings for me, and she asked Aiko to break up our relationship. It totally fooled me. Then the one you were kissing back then was... Wait, Shiyori! It was Aiko. Are you serious... I wanted to get back with you somehow, so I left it to Aiko, and she set it up here. Then the one who chose this village really was... Yeah, it was Aiko. I wanted to apologize to you face to face. I'm sorry. I really like y... Hey... Hello? I'm in Asamiya's car right now. Really. I'm glad. I heard everything. About your true colors too. I was right...

All the while in your mind, I was a stupid girl for being so down, right? No! Stop making fun of me already! You also knew all about the village's secret, right? What are you talking about? Stop trying to play dumb. You murderer. Shiyori, I'll protect you. Starting now and forever. Hello? Aiko, listen, it's something urgent. Akira Mononobe Hello? What's wrong? I wasn't able to reach you for a while. Are you okay? Mr. Mononobe, who are you anyway? My friend looked into it for me. Apparently, your name isn't in the student registry for Jounan University. So that's it, huh? But you definitely said you were from Jounan... I'm an instructor. Did you check the instructor registry too? No way... Welcome to Ashikari Village Hey, Asamiya, that was... Shiyori, please listen. This is new information. I found out the name of the guy who brought my sister to that village. The guy's name is Keiichi Asamiya. He's a former inhabitant of Ashikari. Hey, what's wrong? Shiyori? What happened? Shiyori! Shiyori! Please, save Shiyori. If you're really her friend... That's impossible. It's impossible now. No way! Aiko, you set me up.

The girl in the group can see ghosts, the disasters happen to them.", "content": "Hello everyone, today Black Cat is back to bring you more information on the mysterious death of a security guard. He killed himself by jumping off the building where he worked. The place is also known as Factory 13. \"The Block\" He already looks scary back when he's still alive. He has no friend, except for his mannequins which he keeps around. After his death, people find his mannequins arranged in a strange order. These are not the only rumours about Hieu's death. The owner of this factory took his own life by hanging himself. The mannequins were placed around him in a strange order. It was me who first found the scene. It looked very scary. This isn't the only strange thing here in Factory 13. Hello. Hi. What do you want? We are Black Cat. We come here to find out more about the security guy's death. His name is Hieu. I know his family. He's a good boy. He has to feed his father and his brothers. Hold on. I heard from people around that his ghost is terrifying. How come you don't hear his singing? There is this weird thing that occurs after Hieu's death. People can still hear Hieu singing the song \"Lang Tham\" which is usually performed by Thuy Nhi, from Factory 13. That's it. Every night, I can hear this song echoing from over there. It started 1 year ago. A man's voice. It seems like he's whining every night. The most important thing is they heard the song way before its first performance by Thuy Nhi. Perhaps, Hieu is a friend of the songwriter? \"Singer Thuy Nhi's...\" Good question. \"coming back to showbiz.\" We know that Thuy Nhi is trying to... \"Thuy Nhi's Agent...\" get in touch with Mr Tran Quyet... \"tries to buy the rights\" to get the paperwork... \"to Tran Quyet's song \"Lang Tham\".\" done for her new album. \"Thuy Nhi ran into copyright issues...\" But she... \"with the song \"Lang Tham\".\" hasn’t succeeded. I don't care. Even if Hieu turns into a ghost, I still want to meet him for once. I can conjure his soul if you want. She really means it. Ghosts love her. Sometimes I don't know if I'm talking to her or to her ghost. To be honest, we came here to ask for your permission to stay one night here. I will lose my job if my boss knows. I can't. Go home. Here is some money for you. Just sleep well tonight. You're crazy. Go home! Just go! What are you staring at? I will call the police! You understand? You can see that we have tried to get inside that place by all means. None has worked. Could there be more mysteries about Hieu's death inside the factory. To prove these things are real, we will break into Factory 13 on Friday night, 13th. \"Factory 13\" Please follow our channel for more updates. We will be back soon. We still haven't proved anything yet. Why are you so happy? Don't you see that our views has increased a lot? To me, these numbers mean a little. More important, we haven't found any evidence yet. Now we have a great number of viewers, plus your excellent acting as a ghost-catcher, we all can be famous. My original idea with Black Cat is to make videos based on real events, unlike you, who exploit fake news only to scare people. Keep in mind, Black Cat doesn't belong to you anymore. Right, but don't forget that we are the founders. If you keep making videos like this, we won't cooperate. Ok. I don’t care about the content as long as it can make me famous. Just a sneak peek can get us that many views. Wait until we manage to break in and record what actually happened inside. It's dangerous. He will call the police for sure. Do as I say. Remember who is your boss. Is this the way in? Have you checked carefully? I have memorized the whole map of this factory. I can still move when blindfolded. Do we really need to jam the signal? We already cut the landline. What about the cell phones? He can use his cell phone to call the police. Is everything okay? What are you scared of? The guard might as well sleep like a log by now at the West gate. Besides, he can only scare this dude. Hey, you! The more dangerous it gets, the better the video. I'm sure our channel will be a hit after tonight. Let's go. \"Factory 13\" I go bankrupt because of you two. It's all your fault. Your fault! You! Have you seen someone? Is that a he or she? How weird, you can see images from the sewing machine. You keep seeing your parents everywhere. So boring! There are lots of other pretty ghosts. Stop bothering them. I just worry about her. She's still obsessed with her past. Are you done? Let Vien focus on filming me! Go! Let's go then. Bad actors are always afraid of losing their casting. This is a dead end. Go this way! Hey, come here! Where is Dai? Dai! Dai! What the hell are you doing? Don't you get it? Ok, wait. Do you get it now? Let's move on. Hold on. Whose footprints are these? Could they belong to the mannequins? Let's find out! Let's go. Unite. Divide. Dai, what are you doing? Nothing. Can't you keep your hands to yourself in such a creepy place? Aren't you scared? This way. I know the way. We just need to go through this bush. You have no idea where to go but you are always like \"Let's go and find out.\" This must be where Hieu landed. Let's go check it out up there. Let's go. What's wrong? What's up with you this time? I haven't done anything. Maybe these mannequins are possessed for real. They look gross. Stop messing around. Focus on your job. Vien! As you can see, it took us a lot of effort to get inside the building where the guard jumped off to kill himself. I can feel it here. A lot of people must have died here. The guard isn't the only one. Tonight, Black Cat will prove that ghosts are real. Vien, turn off the camera. Trong, you promised to tell only the truth. We haven't found anything yet so please keep your mouth shut. She caught you man. Poor you. Let's go! Maybe it's the sound of the printing machines. What's going on, expert? Ghosts usually have unfinished business. They haunt the living and continue with their uncompleted work, especially those who die because of injustice. They are powerful and they can haunt anyone, anytime. Perhaps, Mr Phuc… Take a look at this. I was right. These documents are proof that the factory was built over a cemetery. This place must be full of ghosts. Such a valuable information. Cut. I'm the director here, not you guys especially you! You hardly say a word and now all of a sudden, you just say \"Cut\". What's the matter with you? Where is Dai? Maybe he's up to some tricks. Just ignore him. I have a bad feeling about this. Let's go find him. I have this great idea. Vien, film me. Stop it. Why do you keep shooting instead of going searching for Dai? You're so difficult to deal with. I'm not allowed to do anything. What do you really want? If we don't exaggerate, no one would want to watch our videos. Do you think we can just wave the camera around and ghosts will appear? It doesn’t matter. All I need is real evidence, not a bunch of your fake psychic. That's enough. Let's go find Dai. Dai. Dai. Nhu! Dai is upstairs. How do you know? Come. This is Hieu's room. Finally we found the room... where Hieu used to stay before he committed suicide. \"Happiness\" Happiness is so simple. I just want to compose every day, be myself and live with my best friends, which... people often call by the name \"mannequins\". I love you guys. I love my dad's guitar. I'm gay, so what? I haven't done anything wrong to deserve such discrimination, especially from my boss. You should go to hell! Everything looks so old and dirty. Only Hieu's bed and his belongings are still clean. Who's responsible for all of this? Perhaps, Hieu's ghost is still lingering around. That's why people insist that Hieu is living his afterlife. No! Ghost has to possess a body to be able to do such things. Mr Phuc. Why Dai? The guitar… Is there any chance that Dai was possessed and now he's going to jump? What? Will you just let him jump? This is men's business. Vien. Take some photos. Vien. Are you crazy, Dai? I never told you to dress like a guard. Open the door! Don’t you see Dai is over there? It's not him. Follow me! What? Which way now? I never thought Trong would have such chicken liver. By the way, what did he mean when he said that? Are you hiding something from me? Dai was possessed... and Trong said that he had never told Dai to do so. Did you force Dai to act like that so you can film him? Vien. You're the one that understand my family problems most. You know how my dad was beating my mom and me. My dad is possessed for real. Nobody believes me. I have always thought you're the only one who believe me. But now you're joining with them and setting up that hoax. You and Trong are alike. You want to be famous. Coward! You are always Trong's shadow. The way you're scared is just like him. Shut up! I went bankrupt because of you two. It's all your fault. Your fault! You got it? It's all because of your mom and you. If I don't help Trong, your effort will be wasted. I have come up with million ways to win back... our Black Cat channel but you reject them all. Now, I will do it my way! Vien! Vien! Open the door! Vien! Open the door! Vien! Open the door! Please spare me. Hieu. Please spare me. I beg you. Hieu, I'm sorry. Hieu, I'm sorry. I'm so disrespectful. I'm a jerk. I'm a coward. How was my acting, director? Good acting. I'm a jerk. I'm a coward. What the heck. You two… frame me. So? You want to be famous, don't you? I bet you will be famous after this, a famous coward. Hey, you changed a lot in the script. First, Trong asked me to pretend to be possessed by Hieu and jump down. He then would appear suddenly and save me like a hero. You changed the script so I end up not jumping down but turning around and scare the hell out of Trong. He swapped from being a hero to a coward. Betrayer! Scum bags! Cheaters! You... Who's cheating? Black Cat was our idea. It's you who stole it. Do you think you can just buy everything with money? Asshole! I give my first and last love to you. You want to keep my works. They're always yours. My works were inspired by you anyway. You want to love various people. Well, you have the right. Live the life you want. Goodbye then. I will take revenge! \"I hate men\" Live and keep your promise with me. Live and sing for me every day. Mr Phuc. I can't eat anymore. Please have some mercy. This is my time. Hieu. Now you're back, Hieu. Hieu. I know I'm wrong. Please let me go. Hieu. Eat this. Hieu. Eat this and sing for me. Hieu… Please let me go. I will tell everyone that you wrote all these songs. Hieu... Where is Nhu? Vien! Hey, I was just acting. You can come down. What are you doing? Mr Phuc is possessed by Hieu. The guitar, the diary,... they all belong to Hieu. It looks like Hieu is possessing you rather than Mr Phuc. If you don't believe me, watch this. Eat please. It's their business. You have been with us for a while. We have seen everything from robbers to murders. I think he's playing. No way. I witnessed my dad being possessed. I can tell. Your dad wasn’t possessed. He was just drunk when he beat your mom and you. Stop being deluded! You'd better keep your mouth shut. Where is Trong? What did you do to him? Nothing. We just make a hero become a coward. Vien, we should get out of here. Go rescue Trong and call the police. Someone is imprisoned here. Are you insane? The police will arrest us, too. Just ignore him. I've suffered a lot. I'd rather he dies. If you don't want to go, then I will go. Let's go! Oh, where is he? What do you mean? I remember he was lying here. Vien, where is Trong? Maybe he was too scared, so he ran off. Vien... Vien… Vien! Vien. Vien. Vien. Vien! Vien, don't hit him. Vien, don't hit him. It's Hieu, not Mr Phuc. Vien! Vien! Vien. Dai. Vien! Vien! All of you must die! You… I will kill you! You… I will kill you! Don't kill me please. Hieu. Did you just possess her? Hieu. Hieu. My son... Hieu... Hieu, get up. Do you miss me? It's me, your father. Now you're back. My child... Come with me. Come. Come with me. Come with me. I know you're always with me. Who dares to say you're dead. I killed the owner of this factory for what he had abused you. I made them all believe that my son is still alive. \"Love you, son. Love you, dad.\" Today, you're back... in a body that you always desire. Are you happy? Don't worry. I never hate you, whether you're a boy or a girl. Just come with me, dear. I've waited for today long time ago. I made everything for you. So beautiful. Son… That jerk is responsible for your death. This is the song he stole from you. I have taken back all the songs you wrote. Please spare me. Please spare me. Eat this! I swear... I will return the song's copyright to you. Please spare me. Please spare me. Please spare me. Please. Shut up! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat up! Do you think my son died just because of that song? Please spare me! My son is so talent. If he's still alive, he could write many more. You have seduced him, made him fall in love with you and write that song for you. Then you dumped him. He wrote the song with all his love for you. Why did you betray him? Why did you run after someone else? Since you're back, let's kill him. Kill him with your own hands. Kill him, and he will be with you forever. Kill him, so he can sing for you every day. Kill him, take revenge! Kill him! Take revenge! Kill him! Hi everyone. Just a few months ago, sitting on this same chair, I totally believed in ghosts and spirits. When I first started Black Cat channel, I wanted to prove those spiritual things are real. \"Black Cat is The Most Viewed Channel of The Week.\" I'd like to thank you for supporting Black Cat, making it the most followed. \"Black Cat is Officially Shut Down.\" However, I regret to announce that it will be shut down from today. I'm sorry because my belief has changed. It cost me a lot to realize that ghosts don't exist. What's really scary are fame and hatred, disguised under the face of an angel. Be careful with your ambition and love. \"Song Writer Tran Quyet is a Fraud.\" \"Love or Hurt Where Is The Boundary?\" Guy, be careful. Don't make the same mistake like me.

{"title": "Xtro 3: Watch the Skies (1995) - full transcript", "plot": "Marines travel to a deserted island to diffuse bombs, only to be terrorized by a deadly alien creature.", "content": "Men, hold on to your hats. Ladies, hold on to your husbands. This is 22-year-old Melissa meed of Brooklyn, New York. The president of premiere pictures, Walter shapiro, says that the only other actress around with this kind of atomic star quality is Marilyn Monroe herself. And how does miss meed feel about her big break? Oh, well, I don't know. We hear you loud and clear, miss meed, and we're sure you'll be around for a long time. Dateline bignada, Arizona. Attention all would-be martian hunters. What you're looking at are home movies shot by nine-year-old biff atkins of bignada, Arizona. Several weeks ago, young biff sold these movies to this newsreel agency, claiming that the object you're looking at right now was a flying saucer. Well it looks like we've all been bamboozled. Just listen to what our junior Cecil b. Demille has finally confessed. There was no flying saucer. It was a prank I was pulling on my friends. We've explained to biff that his prank made a lot of people very scared and he said he was just having fun. He didn't mean to get the whole country in an uproar. He's been thoroughly punished, we can assure you all. Don't be too hard on him, mom. After all if uncle Sam is willing to let bygones be bygones, shouldn't we all? Biff atkins is to be commended for his honesty. Like all true Americans, he was willing to admit a mistake, when he had to. Mr. Paige! Mr. Paige, it's Erica stern from the daily news. You sent me some photographs. Are you alone? Yeah, I, oh my gosh. I'm sorry, miss, miss stern, please. Please, I'm unarmed, please, come in. I need to... - Okay, all right, okay. - We need to talk. You're my only chance, please, come in. I mean no harm. Step, yeah, thanks, just. You're safe. Close the door. Sit down, please. Looks like you need a doctor. Not until the story comes out. I know once it's out in the open that nobody will dare fuck with me then. Who do you thinks looking for you? You name it, they're looking. But enough with George Paige. That's just a name that I made up. That's who I really am. Lieutenant Martin kirn. Explosives expert, United States marine corps, at least until a few weeks ago. Lieutenant, sit down for a moment. I'm just trying to find this. How's your wife? We divorced, sir, or we should be soon. Yes, of course, my memories not what it used to be. The reason I asked you to come and, yes, here it is. I got a call from the Pentagon. They've lined you up for a bomb disposal operation. Oh. This is classified. And what we say now does not leave the perimeter of this desk. It seems there is an island, about 200 miles off shore, unchartered. During world war il it was used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans, after that for gunnery practice, and then apparently everyone simply forgot it existed. It was lost in the files until finally, some pencil pusher unearthed the file, and they decided to make use of it. They want to build a refueling station, and the catch is they're convinced there's still live ammo there just sitting around. They need a team to go in, find what's there, and get rid of it. What kind of target range are we talking about, sir? I don't exactly want to end up with webbed fingers. No, that was my first question to them. There are no nuclear weapons involved and nothing chemical. I hope this sounds promising to you, because they've already decided you're the man. Actually it does, sir. I could use a break from the classroom. Well, it won't be much of a break. They've assembled a team from your former students. The list is there, I think it's that blue page. Is something wrong, lieutenant? This is quite some list. Corporal dermot Reilly, sir, is a raving psychopath. And Hendricks, I wouldn't trust Hendricks with a cigarette lighter, let alone an assignment like this. Well once these Pentagon boys have their minds made. I understand that, sir, but they don't know my students like I do. Let me see if I can make some headway. The crew is set. Lieutenant, they are absolutely committed. Well, that was an attitude I knew something about. It's what wrecked my marriage. She wanted me to quit the military but I wouldn't. She couldn't take living on bases anymore. When it came down to it, I chose the marine corps over her. I was in that deep. Anyway two days later, the Pentagon flew their guy out. Fetterman, a spook military intelligence, not CIA, but a spook through and through with that typical spook arrogance, like there wasn't one thing happening in the world he didn't know about. Captain fetterman reporting, sir. Captain, this is lieutenant Martin kirn. My assistant, j.G. Watkins. Colonel, sir, may we proceed with the debriefing? Well, captain, the lieutenant would like to take you to lunch first, his way of welcoming you to California. J the shadow, the shadow of doubt j still lingers, but the sound is vague j as each day, as each day goes by I quit, I've had enough. Oh, what the fuck was that? That was not the fucking shot you called. The fuck it isn't, leave him the fuck alone. I'm no good at this stuff anyway. You can't quit now, freak man. He said he quit, so leave him alone, asshole! Since when did you become his mommy? Fuckin' prick! Goddamn it, asshole! Oh, oh, oh! - They're rowdy. - Shut the fuck up! Who's in charge of these men? - Excuse me. - Come on! Come on, baby girl, get out of my way. Get the fuck out of the way! Banta, banta, put that cue down! Right now! - Prick! - Reilly! Reilly, everybody, fall in line! Hustle! Hustle, hustle it up. Sir, I'd like you to meet the people you selected for your assignment. Private dermot Reilly. Wipe the smile off your face, Reilly. Corporal banta. Banta. Private Hendricks. Hendricks, show the captain your finger. How did you lose that finger, Hendricks? Sir, failure to follow your instructions, sir. And last but not least, captain, private Friedman. How do you do? Just thought you'd like to meet the people first hand, captain. Are you a team player, kirn? I believe my record speaks for itself. The crew stays as it is. Watkins! I'll see you outside. Yes, sir. And I'll see you at 0600. By the way, she's off limits. Say hello to your new co, boys. Hey, banta, I'm your relief, and, oh, what a relief I am. Lieutenant tight ass is calling some sort of meeting. Hey, banta, that Watkins, kinda pretty, huh? Fuck you, Reilly. Whoa, banta, slow down, slow down, we have to talk. How'd you end up in the corps, banta? Well, uh, I used to be an ice skater, and there was this other ice skater, this bitch, and I couldn't stand her, so I hired somebody to break her fuckin' leg, so the judge he gave me two options, three years in the military or a year behind bars. So we're the lucky ones? Yes, sir. Actually, of all the those people on this assignment, you're the only one that I halfway trust. Fetterman agrees. He's gonna be setting up a base camp, we'll be splitting up into two teams. I'll be heading one, you'll be heading the other. Thank you, sir. No, don't thank us, just don't prove us wrong. So, Friedman, Hendricks, or Reilly, which one do you want? Ah, anybody, so long as it's not Reilly. Good, you get Hendricks. Put the fucking rifle down. Put the goddamn rifle down. Huh, what's the matter, get in there. I'm fuckin' bored! On second thought... No, no, no second thoughts. Maybe next time you'll think before you speak. Now, you'll both equipped with metal detectors, walkie-talkies, c-4, and timers. We're not gonna take any chances with sophisticated detonation methods on this goddamn island. Whatever we find, we're gonna blow up. You with me? Yes, sir. Good, make absolutely certain your area is clear before you set your charges. You know my rules, I want you to check everything twice, right, twice. Okay, strong suggestion, let Hendricks be in charge of communication, handle the explosives yourself. I'd like to make a point also, lieutenant. This is the first time in 50 years that anyone has stepped foot on that island. Now, I assume that much of the internement camp was destroyed in the testing, but if you should come across any documents, or let's just say any remnants of the camp, you are to bring them directly to me. Is that understood? And it would be in your best interest not to look them over too carefully. What do you mean in our best interest? Exactly what I said. You could say that's when I started to get suspicious. I couldn't put it all together, but somehow I knew this wasn't exactly what I'd bargained for. Figured I'd take Reilly and Friedman, make a sweep from beach to base camp, and I'll radio down when everything's covered. Sounds like a plan. Jesus, captain, we must've been pretty concerned about those Japanese to stick 'em way the hell out here. Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. So, man to man, why is military intelligence still concerned? I only know what the big dogs tell me, kirn. They want to put a refueling station on the island. You and I have the dubious honor of doing the recon. Man to man, I was wrong for insisting on those men, but I like the way you handle 'em. I'm glad I can count on you. As you were. Hendricks, where the hell are ya? I need some help out here. Kirn to base ship, over. Kirn to base ship, over. We read you, over. We completed our sweep. We're going to proceed on. Make sure you follow the trail we've left. Bring tents, the huts are pretty wrecked. Over, do you copy, over? We read ya, over. I don't want you smokin' that shit out in the field. You wanna blow your head off too? Ya got me? Yes, sir. Oh, you're a riot. Whoa, Friedman, our retirement home. Reminds me of lost colony at roanoke. Lost what at where? Ah, in north Caroline in the 16th, 17th century, somethin' like that, these colonists spent the winter, the next year when the ship came to get 'em, the entire colony was gone. The only clue they had was the word croatoan carved into a tree. Lieutenant! I got a bite here! Private, you're gonna hit the fuckin' nose! Come on, go scout cover. Oh baby. I hate to break this to ya, but you went out of style with ho chi minh. Friedman, let me have some c-4. Lieutenant, I got some cover over here. What have we here? Base camp to kirn. Everybody all right, over? Hey, everybody all right? Yeah. We're all fine. Look, fillings. I don't think he flossed either. Go get fetterman. J must've turned it on when you turned it down what? J I hear ya talkin' but talk is cheap j you promised me gold j I gotta try to pull this around j from you whoa, that looks like blood. What are you doing? Find out what we hit. You know, kirn's rules, don't put your feet where you ain't made a sweep. A rabbit? They got rabbits way out here? What do I look like, a fuckin' zoologist? Don't! What are we gonna do, let it suffer? Whoa. Somethin' happened to the music. Hendricks, don't take off like that. You're gonna lose your fuckin' legs as well as your finger. It's fuckin' gone. What? My fuckin' radio, it's fuckin' gone. People die, lieutenant. They die in internment camps, they die in San Diego. You obviously happened across a graveyard. This many people? Maybe there was an outbreak of influenza. Is there any mention of influenza in any of the records, captain? The records I've seen, lieutenant, are spotty at best, but if you're trying to suggest what I think you are, you're way out of bounds to even think the us military would slaughter its citizens during war. No way. I'd be the last person in the world to suggest something like that. You told me to report anything I find. That's exactly what I'm doing. No one has been here for 50 years, isn't that what you said? That's right. 1955. Now, unless my math has gone way downhill, I'd say that makes for 40 years. Your math is excellent, lieutenant. It's your attitude that stinks. Watkins! I decided from then on I wasn't going to show him shit. I got together with my men at lunch and told them to set their walkie-talkies to a different channel. If they found anything, I didn't want fetterman to know. Guess what? By sunset, we'd found something new. This way, guys. Did you sweep the area? Yeah. What about these houses, they all clean? You check 'em? All clean. I found all these, like, fish and things, like. What the fuck was that? All day we've been hearin' it, ain't we, bantha? Yeah. Igor, it lives. I guess this explains the rabbits. What rabbits? Well, Hendricks and I hit a rabbit goin' down the road. Since then we've seen, maybe, 10 of 'em. More like 20. Must've been some big rabbits. I figure they were bein' used in experiments. After the war, they were abandoned, and then they spilled out into the jungle. All it takes it two, and pretty soon you've got a whole tribe. Lucky for them they weren't lesbians, banta. Yeah? Why don't ya try me sometime? What about that boneyard? I think they were using people. I think they were using people as human Guinea pigs. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, wake up. What? Listen. It's the wind, Friedman. Up, everybody up! Reilly, go with me, Hendricks, you cover our backs! Friedman, go get the others. What, what are we looking for? What's going on, where? Where, where are they? What's going on? Ssh, turn out the lights. Come in. - Holy shit! - What the fuck is this? Where the fuck did this guy come from? Ah, man. There's not supposed to be anyone on this island, you know. Everybody calm. - I got a gun over here. - Don't, don't, don't! Hold it right there, buddy. Hold it right there. We're friends. - Hold it. - We're friends. We are friends. What's your name? Nobody's gonna make it out of here alive! - I got this. - What's your name? We are friends. - Come on, get him. - Get him. Nobody's gonna get out of this alive. - Okay. Move, Watkins. Come on, move out. - Yes, sir. Nobody's gonna get out of this alive. Nobody's gonna yeah, all right, all right, we heard it, we heard it! Get out of this alive. Watkins, rub him down with a bar of soap, disinfect the fucker, and find him some new clothes. Yes, sir. Nobody's gonna get out of this. They've given up on the entire project! What project? - Friedman! - Nobody's gonna get outta of this. - Yes, sir. Do you have something else you could be doing? I'm sure I could find something. Well, why don't you go find it. Locating something to do, sir. Terrible party. Well, I talked to him for a couple of hours. I didn't find out a fucking thing. What I figure is he's a pilot, downed a plane around here somewhere, so tell your men to keep an eye out for the fuselage. Have you come across any of it? - No. - None of us are gonna get out of this alive. Tell them to look for his shelter too. He's gotta have a shelter around here somewhere, right? All right, people, he's fascinating, but we got a job to do, right? How do you think the old man did it, huh? Livin' in the middle of nowhere, years and years. Eating what? Birds, coconuts, rabbits. And no one around to talk to. Yeah, I know how that feels. You know how that feels? What are you kiddin' me? I know how it feels to have no good conversation. Fuck you, Friedman. If you're so smart, what are you doin' here in the first place? Her name was carmelita. Detonation kirn, yeah, we read you, over. Hendricks, did you sweep the area? Yeah, all clear. Get it, get a move on. Four, three, two. Goddamn you, Hendricks! You didn't fuckin' sweep the area! Fucking idiot. We're practically sitting on live ammo. I'm sorry! We could've been killed. Why don't ya get mad already? Jesus, you blew a hole in the thing, you idiot. Cool. It's concrete. Hendricks, I don't know about this. Hendricks! Hendricks! Hendricks, what's going on in there? Jesus Christ. Friedman, first aid. Banta, banta, what happened? What happened, what happened? Something, I, I, couldn't, it was green. Okay, this is gonna sting. You know, you remind me of my grandpa. After he had his stroke, I used to take care of him, give him a bath, take him for walks. They're sending planes to stop it. They're gonna wait until he goes back inside, and then they're gonna cover it with cement. That's the only way. I know, okay? I know all about it. All right, I'm gonna go get a razor, and I'm gonna give you a shave. I'll be right back. I tried for over an hour, sir, but all he does is rant and rave. Makes absolutely no sense, but as you know, all he has to do is say one thing that does make sense, and that's it, it's out to the inquiring minds. I agree, sir. Well, he's old. I can smother him, pass it off as a heart attack. Yes, sir, will do, out. Where was the last place you saw Hendricks? Wouldn't it be better off just leaving him inside there, huh? Tag. You're it. Fucking great. Mother of Christ. Lieutenant! - What? - You gotta see this. Did you find him? Just get in here! Don't leave me alone. You're not alone, you've got Friedman. I got somethin', lieutenant. Got it? Yeah. Give banta some light. You all right? Yeah. Geez. All right, what's this? Turn the light off, lieutenant! Holy shit. Whatever the fuck it is, it's light sensitive. What's up ahead there? Let's check this out here. Hendricks! You can stand up here. Hendricks! Be careful. Yeah, I'm gonna be. Hendricks! Captain fetterman. Captain fetterman. The survivor got away. He got. Sorry, sir, I was giving him a bath, and I just left him for a second to get a razor, and then when I came back he was gone. I told you to come get me before you did that, didn't 1? Yes, sir. You goddamned idiot! You fucked it all up! Base camp to kirn, come in. Uh, this is Friedman. The lieutenant's, uh, not available, over. Spread the word, the old geezer got away. He attacked Watkins. Shoot to kill. Shoot to kill? That's an order, Friedman, shoot to kill! Put kirn on. Friedman, where is kirn? Well, we, uh, found this concrete block, and Hendricks blew it open and disappeared inside, and, well, I guess kirn and everybody else went in to find him, over. Well that's it. That's it. We're finished here. Captain? Base camp, come in, over. Hendricks' lighter. Looks like some kind of animal. I don't wanna know what it is, lieutenant. I just wanna get the fuck outta here. Reilly, calm down. This place is givin' me the fuckin' creeps. We've gotta find Hendricks. Right now, banta, I don't give a fuck about Hendricks. Get out of my way. Reilly. Hey, wait a second. - Hey, listen, hey. - Listen, I say we got through. - That's an order. - Corporal, let's turn back. You leave it alone, banta. Hendricks. Come on, let's turn back. Holy shit. Can you believe this? That's a typewriter. A radio. Take it easy, guys. A fucking cow. It's a dead Jersey steer, whoa, what? - Oh shit. - Oh look there's a body in here. Banta, banta, freeze, don't touch it. Oh my fucking Christ, he's been ripped to shreds. Goddammit, give me a hand in here. Forget it, lieutenant, he's fucking dead, let's go. - What the fuck was that? - Let's go, let's go, lieutenant. Come here, let's go. Banta, come on! Come on! I'd gone in there thinking it was some kind of defense project, but human beings couldn't have made that thing. Then I figured with Hendricks being dead that I finally had a right to the facts. The only problem was fetterman wasn't around to give 'em. The boat, where's the fuckin' boat? There's no fucking way off! Stating the obvious again. You know, I've had just about enough of you. You little Jew freak. I'm gonna give it to ya, goddamn! Oh, yeah, well fuck you. Shut the fuck up, both of you! Here's the plan. We're goin' back to camp, we're all gonna post guard, and I'm gonna find us a way off this fucking island. You saw that thing today, kirn. You saw what it did to Hendricks. You think bullets are gonna stop that thing? Private, you shut the fuck up now! Get goin', move it. They wanted the lowest of the low, and except for you, that's what they got. They figured that if certain things came to light, they might need to take measures to make sure that nothing leaked out. You're all considered expendable. Yes, sir. Does that include you? I guess it does now. Who knows? Maybe all along. What about this thing we found today? I only know the basics. I know that it crash landed in Arizona in 1955. The military brought it here for study. Somehow they managed to cover up the landing and the disaster that went on later. Which was? The life form inside the ufo went crazy. It started killing everyone on the island. The government couldn't do anything to stop it. They sent airplanes in. They covered up the ufo, the thing inside it, with concrete. Any survivors... Were left to die. That's what they intend to do with us. Maybe, but they didn't have any way to communicate. Now, you're sure guardino's not in on this? I don't know. Kirn, aren't you still on the island? I'm here, but fetterman isn't. He stranded us. He what? Stranded us. Sir, I need transportation off the island as fast as possible, do you copy? Can you do that for me? Yes, of course I can. But what exactly happened, what's going on? If I told you, you'd never believe it. All right, hold your position and stay on this line. We'll have you out of there as quickly as we can. Yes, Martha, my tickets to the music center this evening. Are those eight or 8:30? Are we being joined? Well, the general said something about, no dice? Oh well, not to worry. Okay, thank you, that's it. Hey. Hey, hey. Ow! Son of a. Just call me gracey. Come on, twinkle toes. That fuckin' guy, do you believe that? Fucking prick. Go get kirn. You gonna be all right? Get outta here. Come here. Come on, old man. It's the old guy. He's keepin' his distance. All these years he's been living here, he survived that thing. He survived those bombings. I'll bet ya he's got a safety zone somewhere, you know, some kind of shelter. Yeah. And maybe he's tryin' to lead us there. So, how does it feel to be a beast of fucking burden? I don't know, you tell me. They could've radioed ahead. Could've taken the Jeep up later, but no. Tight asses always gotta do it the hard way. That's kirn for ya. Go find banta, I'l stay with the old guy. Wow. Yeah, fancy place you got here. Great, uh-huh, need those pans. Bunny. Hey, that's a cute rabbit. It's your little pet? Friend, friend, friend. Yeah. Roommate? My friend, my friend. Looks just like ya. Banta! Banta! I got too much shit on me, Reilly. Hey, bozos, where are you? Guys! Wait up. Fuck. What the hell? What? Do I have to, come on, come on. Bantal banta! Bantal Who's there? Who's there? Who is it? Friedman! Christ, Friedman. Oh god, oh god, somebody help us! Reilly, come on, Reilly! We're right behind you, help me. I don't know what to do. - Shit. - 1 don't know what to do. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. Get him back to the bunker. I'm sorry, come on. Reilly, we gotta find banta. - Are you okay? - She's gotta be dead. I don't hear her screamin' no more. These must be old stag movies, huh? That's how you went so long without sex, I bet. I think it's pregnant. Might be films of that research they were doin'. Come on, Reilly, move your fat ass. In a second, in a second. I can't believe that fuckin' thing still works. It's a good thing it's German. Friedman, can you fix the fuckin' focus, please? I'm tryin', all right? You do that again and you are a dead old man. That's him. That's the old man. Sure as hell looks that way. It's a chameleon. We sat there for a long time, nobody saying anything. I kept thinking about what I'd seen that day. The way this thing just didn't kill Hendricks. It eviscerated him, which was exactly what we had done to its mate. Couldn't figure out which was worse, it or us. What are you doing? What does it look like? I'm gonna find banta, or at least her body. Anybody care to join me? Wish me luck. Semper fi. All right, watch your step. Once you get in those goddamn webs, you don't get out. Don't worry, lieutenant, I'm not goin' anywhere near those nasty things. They're everywhere. Lieutenant, I got it. That's an 86 on the phone. What's that? I'm outta here. Ah, no, no, no, listen. I think that's banta. I'm goin' up the tree for a better look, keep me covered. All right. Got me covered? Yeah, yeah. Can you see anything, lieutenant? Yeah, I can see. It's torturing here like, like she's some kind of fucking toy. Reilly, I'm not gonna leave her like this. We can't fucking get to her either. Shit. That fuckin' thing isn't here anymore. That's what I'd want. Get the fuck out of here. J oh the old gray mare j she ain't what j she used to be knock it off, old man. J ain't what she used to be knock it off, old man. J the old gray mare j she ain't what she I said knock it the fuck off! - Reilly! Reilly, put it down, put it down, put it down! I can't fuckin' take this stuff anymore. This fuckin' waitin' for somethin' to happen is drivin' me fuckin' crazy. I'm gonna fucking kill somebody. Reilly, you put that gun away. I swear to Christ, I'll shoot ya myself. If they don't get here soon, you can stick a fork in me, I'll be done. Yeah, well maybe I'm crazy, but I'm more concerned about what the hell we're gonna do when we get home than how we're gonna get there. Yeah, knowing what battle you walk into, you are definitely out there. Yeah, well what do you think? You think we're just gonna go back to our same little lives? Well I know fetterman, and I know what he's capable of. I know what he does to people who know too much, and that means us. I got the answer to that right here. A camera? We take this and the film and the papers the old man saved up, and we got right to the media. They're not gonna hurt anybody who's in the spotlight. Let me see that. You've been walkin' around all this time making a documentary, and I don't know anything about this? Yeah. Friedman, you're a genius. Well, I'm so happy we figured out next month, lieutenant. But we still got right now to worry about, and I'm gonna tell you somethin', they are not comin' for us. What's that? Hey, guys, we got two choppers outside! I've had a lovely time, but I'd like to go now. Watkins. Old man, not again, please, no more! Take cover! Fuckin' tryin' to kill us! Watkins, behind you, go! No, no, stay put, we're safe here. Fuck, I left the hatch open. I left the hatch open. I'll get it. No, Friedman. I'll get it. Watkins. Yeah? Take the camera. - Huh, what? - Take the camera. - Why? - Go on, take it. Friedman! - He's fucked. - Get the hell outta here. Come on, move it! - Reilly. Move it! Old man, move, come on! Reilly! Watkins! Come on! Hurry! Oh shit. Watkins, take this, take this! Go, go, go! Take my hand! Come on! Reilly! Come on. Careful. Hey! Hey, old timer, come on down. There ya go. Come on. Come on. When we first discovered this thing, I remember Reilly saying it was light sensitive, so maybe it was actually powered by solar energy, maybe that's why it landed back in '55 in a place where the sun was shining bright. It was trying to recharge itself, and then it made the mistake of thinking it could trust the people who'd stumbled on it, the same mistake I made with fetterman. Semper fi. Guard that with your life. Look, we've got lots of timber out here on the beach. Maybe we could build ourselves a raft. We can haul the engine out of the Jeep, hook up a propeller, what do you think, Reilly? With all due respect, lieutenant, you're grasping at straws. Straws are the only thing we've got. Yeah, well, building a raft takes time, and we got that thing roaming around, and we'd just be gettin' started before it found us. Jesus Christ, look at this, hey, hey, hey! That's c-4. Don't fuck with that shit. Blow us all up. Wait a second. The old guy just gave me a great idea. We did it! Son of a bitch, we did it! Let's just hope that fucking holds it. It worked for 40 years, didn't it? Come on, let's get going. The president has denied allegations of an affair. As for the sudden departure of the first lady, a white house spokesman says she's just taking a much needed vacation. What? A much needed vacation. That's about what I said when my wife first left me. You know, it took me months to admit she was even gone. You were married? She was a very good looking woman, your wife. Hubba hubba. I was almost engaged once. Right out of high school to my high school sweetheart. We both went into the service together. Didn't work out. He ran off with his platoon captain. Spokesman at camp Pendleton have still not released the names of the five marines killed yesterday in an explosives accident. The deaths came during a training session for bomb disposal. The identity of those marines and a Pentagon military advisor, also killed in the accident, will be released pending notification of relatives. Those sons of bitches. Goddamn those dirty sons of bitches. My parents are probably close to committing suicide right now. My parents are probably celebrating. I'm gonna find those films. They can dispute photographs, but they'll never explain away those films, and I'm gonna find them. I'll find 'em if it takes me all goddamn night. Hey, lieutenant, you're really startin' to stink, you know that? You caught a whiff of yourself lately, Reilly? Oh, you're right, how 'bout we take a break? Go down to the beach and take a little swim, huh? We're gonna be at the beach just as soon as we finish. I wanna float this thing right down the stream. Come on, lieutenant, what do ya think, Watkins? You wanna go down and take a dip in the ocean? With you? Yeah. Dressed in what? I don't know, don't ya have a thong on under there? Yeah, you wish. Come on, lieutenant, what do ya say? Go ahead, be back in 15 minutes. Yes, yes. Wanna come? Nah, I got a lot of work to do. Come on. You're gettin' to be the only one I can count on. Watkins! Come on! Watkins, let me see you! You probably remember lieutenant Johnson. As a matter of fact, you probably know the rest of the team too. Wolf. Wolf, come in goddammit. Sorry, sir, what is it, sir? Two down, three others still at large. Proceed with your crew. Roger, heading out, sir. Where are the others? They're dead. Lying to me, aren't ya? No, no, they were all killed in the air raid. Where are the bodies? I'll show you. All right. Where you goin'? - Okay, just hold on. - I can't get out. No, hold on, give me your arm. I can't move my fuckin' hands. We're gonna get you outta here, give me your hand. It's stuck! - Come on, give me your hand. - We're all stuck in shit, you asshole. Get me outta here, kiss my ass. Go on, move! There, in that cave. It was sealed up in the air raid. Everyone died inside. Johnson, get me some c-4. Yes, sir. How come you didn't get 'em outta there? You had the explosives with you. No, sir, they had the explosives with them, sir. Captain fetterman. Captain fetterman. Go for fetterman. Uh, we've got a situation here, sir. Smith is, well, he's stuck, sir, in some kind of web. What do you mean he's stuck? Well, I don't know, sir. It's like it's just all sticky and I don't know what the hell's goin' on. Do you have any idea what he's talking about? No, sir. Where are ya? Well, sir, I'm not sure. We crossed a stream. We're probably about three quarters of a mile from the pier, and I don't know. Well, that's real specific, Nichols. Hold tight, we'll be there asap. Yes, sir. Johnson. Yes, sir. I want you to blow a hole in that cave entrance. - Yes, sir. - Move it! I don't think I can do this. Sure ya can. Get in there. It appears someone's been in here, sir. I knew you were lying to me, Watkins. Last chance, where are they? They don't seem to be around here anymore. Get it off! What? What's the matter? What, the cave? Ow, shit, you fucking cut me, man. Well, hold still then. What the fuck is this shit? Where the fuck is fetterman? Kirn, where are you? Kirn! Where are you? Where are you? Kirn! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Fetterman's here. They're gonna kill us. I know, I know, his men are in the webs. Shh, shh. Shh. Listen to me, they killed Reilly. They killed, they wanted me to take them to you, so I led them to the cave. Don't move! Freeze, hold still. - Right there, do not move. - Turn around. - Turn around. - Do not move, put your hands behind you. - Get your hands behind you! - Hands behind your back. Go. Wolf, what was that you were sayin' before that, what did you say, something that Smith ran into a web? Yeah, I don't know what it was. It was some kind of sticky web or somethin'. Yes, yes, I see it now. They're all over the place. Tell me about it, it's fuckin' everywhere. Wolf, I want you to come and get me. Do you read, over? I'll try, sir. God, what the fuck is goin' on here? What the fuck is goin' on here? It's okay, it's okay. Come on. It's all right, okay. Just give me a second. The cam is, the cam. Okay, okay. Is it okay, is it okay? It's okay, the camera's fine, Watkins. I said the camera's fine. Watkins? Watkins. Watkins, they're all gonna find out. Everybody's gonna know. Even if I gotta jam this right into their skulls, Watkins. That's far enough, kirn. Now, come on down. They're all dead. I found every single fucking one of 'em dead. Just like you wanted. I'm not talking about those worthless fucks with you! I'm talkin' about my men! What happened? What you spent 40 years tryin' to cover up. No, I'm not gonna be accountable for that. That's why I'm takin' you back with me to explain. Why don't you just shoot me now, fetterman? Go ahead, wipe your slate clean. I'd love to, kirn, but you're my excuse, man, with your life. Nice and easy, that's it. Now, after you. Go on! Kirn! Kirn, kill it, shoot it! Kirn, shoot it, kirn! Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it! Kill it, kirn, shoot it, kirn. Semper fi. I wonder, you know, I wonder what it was thinking. I know what I'd like to believe, that there might be hope yet for the human race. He vanished almost the second we hit the dock. One moment he was there, and the next he's gone. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures of him, but I can give you a description. If you could find him, he'd be the perfect corroboration. Well, a corroboration would be very helpful, but I'm sure you realize this is gonna be one tough sell. But you gotta get a helicopter out to that island. I mean, the film, the film will be there, the webs, those bodies, it'll all still be there. If the government hasn't already cleaned it up. Yeah. Stern! Stern, you will print the story? If you can convince my editor the way that you've convinced me, sure, absolutely. Well, coming up we have Johnny sendum with the weather, and Teddy lyons backstage with last night's grammy winners. But first, more on the saga of marine lieutenant Martin kirn. Kirn, you'll recall, was reported dead in a freak accident at camp pendelton only to surface later with a bizarre story involving an unidentified flying object and a coverup plot by the federal government. Well, a court appointed psychiatrist has found that kirn is suffering from paranoid delusions. Moreover, the military has come forward with several witnesses who testified that kirn deliberately set the explosion at camp pendelton. That explosion, you'll recall, killed five marines and a visiting representative from the Pentagon. In addition, photographs of the alleged ufo have been proven fraudulent by several specialists. They're lying. They're lying, they're lying. They're lying! They're lying! They're lying, they're lying. They're lying! They're lying!", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xtro_3_Watch_the_Skies-115006", "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/143.0.0.0"},

Come on, Katie! - Mum, wait! - Come back soon. Tony! Tony! Come on! Katie! Katie! Go on, Katie! - Come on! Come on! Come on! - Really high! - Come on. - Wow! Dad! Dad! What's happening? I don't know. - Dad! - Tony! - Dad! - Tony! Get back! Get back, Tony! Dad! Daddy! Tony! Agh! Daddy! Dad! Daddy? Tony, what's happened? Did you have a bad dream? Tell me about it. Daddy was looking at me. Darling, it was only a dream. Come on. But he was taken away. He left us. Now, you know that. He'll come back. He still loves us. Of course he loves us. Go to sleep. Good night, darling. What's wrong? Don't worry, Analise, it's the same thing. Shall I talk to him? I don't understand this nightmare. I thought he'd got over all that. He needs a father. But you're here. He doesn't like me. - That's not true. - It is true. He's obsessed with Sam. \"Daddy did this.\" \"Daddy could do it better.\" It's been three years. How can he remember all that stuff? He likes you. Does he? Of course. He doesn't feel that you're his father yet. You just need more time together. What is it? Can you see anything? Stay in the car. Get back in the car! Ben? Ben? - We continue our late-night concert... - Ben? With Sviatoslav Ashkenazy's interpretation... of Debussy's 29th Prelude... Ben? Leave it! Come on, let's go. Mummy! - Mummy! - Tony? - Mum. - Hi, Tony. It's all right, sweetheart. You've had a bad dream. Let's go back to bed. What is it? What's the matter? Hm? Hungry? Din-dins? There. Who is it? Who is there? Who's there? Divine! Come back! What do you think you're doing? Divine! Divine! Where are you? Come back! Divine! Come on! Be quiet! Feeling better? Are you angry with me? What's wrong? Is it Joe? - Daddy's hurt. - What? Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Joe! Don't be frightened, Mum. Where does it hurt? I won't be cross. Don't worry, Mum. Joe! What's the matter? Call a doctor. - Christ! What's he done? - Quickly! Analise! Get Analise! Hurt? - No pain at all? - No. Then where did that blood come from? - I don't know. - From you? Daddy sent it. How did he send it? Dunno. Just felt something sticky. I think it's time you got some sleep. Into bed then. Thanks, doctor. Is that all? - Goodnight, Tony. - Goodnight. Snuggle right down, sweetheart. Night night. Sleep well, love. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? He appears to be perfectly healthy. If he'd lost that much blood, he'd be too weak to tell us anything. He hasn't told us anything anyways. I'll test his sample, of course, but I'm quite certain it's not Tony's blood. Well, if it's not Tony's blood, whose is it? You're saying he's pulled some grotesque prank? Why? Could your husband possibly have been in contact with Tony? - Without your knowing it? - No. I think you're making a big thing out of it. He's a resourceful kid. He has a big imagination. He doesn't need Sam to help him come up with a trick like that. Joe, just say out of this, please, will you? I think we can all agree that Tony has had a rather traumatic experience. And he does still seem to insist that his father disappeared in this bizarre manner. Yeah. He won't accept that his father ran out on him so he has him disappear in a flash of light. Psychology 101. Mrs Phillips, may I suggest that Tony might benefit from some professional help in this area? Listen to me. Tony simply misses his father. He doesn't need thousands of expensive psychiatrists, only a little time and care. Hold on, Analise. Just let him finish. It's just a suggestion. I'll ring you tomorrow and if you'd like me to arrange something for you, you can let me know then. Good night, Mrs Phillips. Goodnight, Miss... Mercier. Miss Mercier. Come on, he's doing his best. Yeah. Stupid doctors. All a doctor can think of is another doctor. Oh, come on, poor thing. You need a rest. It isn't Tony. It's Sam. What do you mean? I mean all this nightmare business. It reminds you of Sam. And what about Joe? Oh, I don't know. I don't want to think about it. OK. Good night. Sleep well. Night, Analise. Thanks. See you in the morning. Hello? What? Ra... ch... el... Who? Er... Look, Mummy. Mummy, watch. Marvellous, darling. Finish your breakfast. Finished a one-mile hike. Analise? Analise? Mum, his trousers keep falling down. Oh dear, darling. - Joe, get Analise. - OK. Come on, Analise, let's go. Tired. What time is it? Tony time. Is he going to school? Yup. - What about last night? - Forget it! Is she awake? I don't know. With her it's hard to tell. Morning, Tony. How are you doing? I'm OK. Listen, I'm going to be doing some pictures of old aeroplanes today. Why don't you come along? Maybe even get you a ride in one of them? - Maybe. - Ah, come on, you'll love it. Don't really know. Tony! I don't want Harry in the kitchen. Put him back in his tank. Don't worry, Harry. Daddy likes you. I like Harry too, but not in the kitchen. And he's not going to school. Oh, Mum! I'm doing those shoes today with Paula. Can you come and look after the lab work? I'm picking up Tony. What about Analise? She's got other plans. Oh, I see. She's got other plans. What did Tony say about last night? I didn't ask him. I'm not going to push it. Hey, Tony! School time! Come on, Tony! Morning! Hello! And how's my little Tony? - I could eat you up. - Tony, come on. - Getting so tall! - Eugh! Work hard at your lessons, young man. Diligence pays. Tony! Sorry about that. Are you all right? Shit! Oh, leave it! - I've got to go. - They'll ring back. - I can't. - It's not important. No. Hello? Rachel. You're not busy? Well, do we need any food? Mm-hm. How much? Yeah, yeah. What size? Well, what about liver? - Are you all right? - No, no, it's OK. I... I just had a pain. In my leg. No, it's OK. - Look, I'll pick Tony up. - Yeah. I'll see you about five. See you. How long have we got? Long enough. OK, Paula, could you stop eating? We don't want to see the crumbs on your toenails. Kev, can you just get rid of that stuff? That's good. And dust off the shoes. That's it. - Nearly there, Joe. - OK. Now... Hang on. Can you remove the food, Kevin? Take it away. Oh! I haven't finished yet. I don't want to see your fat foot here. Thank you very much. Paula, you're not selling an orthopaedic shoe. OK, Paula. Could you just arch the foot a bit? Think of that foot as your face, and smile. Cheese! Bloody cheese! Paula, let's stop messing around now and just look beautiful. - Kev, give me back my sandwich. - That's it. Have you rounded up those dupe negs yet? They'll be at the lab at four. - I'm off to get Tony. - OK, I'll see you later. Listen, we'll have to do one more for Lloyd so just keep the novocaine on the foot, OK? I'm going to take him to the zoo. See if he'll talk to me. Mm, it's a good idea. Paula, please stop drooling. Hello? Where's Tony? Has he been kept in? No. His father picked him up. That's impossible. A few minutes ago. You just missed them. It can't have been Tony. I saw them leave myself. Which way did they go? Tony! Tony? Hi, Mum. Sam! Hello, Rachel. Mum! Your mum's upset. You bet I'm upset. Good to see you, Rachel. Looking well. What are you doing here? - I'm back. - You're back? Back from where? I'm not sure. You're not sure? You disappear for three years without a word. I don't know where I've been. I can't remember a thing until today. - I saw Tony in the street so I... - You want to come home. Like it was. That's it, isn't it? I knew you'd come back. They didn't believe me. Who's they? Three years, Sam. Three years. You wait here, Daddy. You'd better clean yourself up. There's a razor in the bathroom. I'll get you something else to wear. Do you want a drink? Still Scotch? Please. Dad! Say hello to Harry. Hello, Harry. Whoa! He's beautiful. Daddy, are you going to stay with us? Are you back for good? Yeah. He picked up Tony from school. Oh, yes, I'm serious. He doesn't know. He's lost his memory. Mum said you can wear these. Harry's laid four eggs. How long before they hatch? Well, wait and see. Eugh! That's Joe's. How should I know? Joe... Joe, please just get over here. Who was that girl with you this morning? Analise. She lives here. What does she do? She helps Mum. She's French. Better? Do you recognise this? Yes. I think I do. Sam, what's the last thing that you remember? The cottage. We were at the cottage. I was with Tony. You'd gone away. - Then it started. - What did? First this light, this brilliant light above me. I could see Tony was scared. He... He kept yelling but I... I couldn't hear him. It was as if I was held in that light. And a wind, a strong wind. It was hot. Felt good. Sounds like one of Tony's stories. Was it you on the phone this morning? No. Joe will be back in a minute. Hello there, Miss Goodman. Ooh, good evening, Mr Daniels. I see you're walking up the stairs again. Yes, it helps me get to my apartment. Oh, so it's your apartment. I see Mr Phillips is back. I'll miss our little talks. Come on, Dad. - Rachel? - In here, Joe. - Hi. - Hi. - Sh-sh! - That one. Oh, Daddy! Well, Sam, how long have you been back? Um... Just today. Where are you staying? He hasn't arranged anything yet. Tony, time for your bath. - I want to stay with Daddy. - Tony... You going to be around for a while? Oh, for the time being. What are your plans? - Analise, Daddy's back. - I don't know. I haven't got any work lined up, if that's what you mean. Mm, things are pretty tight. Won't be easy. I hear you're busy. I've been lucky. You know me, Sam. Look British, think Yiddish. Joe, would you like a drink? Yeah, that'd be nice. - Sam? - Um, no thanks. Analise, keep an eye on Tony, will you? OK, OK! So you've been... taking care of things, have you? Yeah. Look, Sam, what do you want? I want to be home. This isn't your home any more. That should be obvious. I'm just bringing these in. I can't handle this. Look, I don't know what to say to the guy. He thinks he's going to move back in. Well, give him time. Time! He has had three years! He has got to go. Where could he go? This is the only place he's got. Rachel, he walked out on you. I don't know that he did. I see. He can't remember anything. That is garbage, Rachel. He tried something new. He ran away on his family and it didn't work out so he comes back. What else do you expect him to say? You don't know him. I married him and I lived with him. And now you live with me. I just don't trust him. Tony. Tony! Tony, supper time. Come on. Hurry up, darling. Tony, where are you? Tony? Tony? Joe, have you seen Tony? Isn't he with Sam? Joe, he's taken him. Tony? Don't hide from me. What's the matter? You were eating Harry's eggs. I needed them. What for? I'm not the same as before. Do you remember when they took me? Yes. I went to another world. I had to be changed so I could live there. Why did they take you? I was lucky. It could have been anyone. Why did you come back? I came back for you. - And Mum. - Of course. Do you want to come with me? Don't be afraid. I'm your dad. Going to catch your death of cold, you are. Joe, we'd better call the police. We should never have left him alone with Tony. That's what he came back for. Come on, Dad, it's my turn. Come on, Dad! Where have you been? We went to buy some sweets. Well... Would you mind letting me know where you're going next time? Of course. You haven't done that properly. No, I haven't stuck... Oh, another one! And now news of fresh disasters. I'm speaking from the car park where only hours ago the hideously mutilated body of a young woman was discovered. One senior police officer said, \"This is an act of the most monstrous brutality.\" - You look different from your picture. - Really? Mm, you look much younger. Don't you think so, Rachel? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. A change is as good as a rest, right, Sam? Gets you back in shape. It is odd you arrived at this moment. You know Tony's been dreaming about you. I'm glad he hasn't forgotten about me. Did he tell you what happened last night? Yes. He's missed me. - You two get along? - Oh, very well. He wants you to stay, you know. How long will you be here? - It's not up to me. - Not long. - It's not up to you either. - Please. - As a matter of fact, it is up to me. - Joe! Because Rachel's divorcing you. - Joe, not now. - But why not now? Everyone's here. Right. So I have a little announcement I'd like to make. Rachel and I are going to get married. - Oh, great! - Thank you. I'm so happy for you. Sam! You crazy maniac. You're out of your fucking mind! Daddy! Daddy? You didn't have to dump that on him. He should be in a hospital. What is it, son? It started on its own. I didn't mean to. I was just thinking about the noise it made. That's all it takes. If you think hard about something... ...you can make it happen. But I couldn't stop it. - I tried. - Look... You'll be able to do lots of things. Don't be frightened. Use it when you need it. What for? Well, you'll know when the time comes. You'll feel it. Like when you were hurt by that car? I knew what was happening. Remember, it's our secret. We're a team, right? Right. Do you like Analise? Perfect. It's just what we need. But... you mustn't damage her, OK? I think this belongs to your son. Oh, God! Harry! It appeared in my supper. How did it get there? I'm not interested. Clearly your son is not responsible enough to look after animals. Anyway, it's ridiculous keeping a snake as a pet. I'm sorry. She's just a stupid woman. Tony... No. Tony... Look at me. Later. - Night. - Bonne nuit. I've hunted out some more of your own clothes. You didn't throw them out. Good night. What are you going to do? Look, he can't stay here. You know that. Oh, don't push me. Letting him stay isn't going to help, and it won't do Tony any good either. Hello? When he left I knew exactly what I'd say to him if he came back. And what I felt. And now I don't know. If that's how you feel, what the hell am I doing here? Darling, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. That's Miss Goodman. She killed Harry. Quick! It's Mum! If I hear another squeak out of you tonight, I'll be very angry. - Do you understand? - Yes, Mum. That's her again. I hate her. All right, I'm coming! Oh! What do you want? Morning, parrot. Have some breakfast. Here. Come on, speak to me, parrot, huh? Why don't you speak to me? Do you remember when that was taken? I'd just painted the bedroom ceiling. You can see the paint in my hair, look. I can't remember who took it. I did. On the timer. Oh yes, you balanced it in the tree. God, it was so hot that summer. - Telephone! - Coming. - Is it Joe? - No, it's a doctor. Oh. Hello? Oh. Well, that's a relief. No pain at all? No, no, he's been OK today. Um... However, he might be able to talk to someone more... Thanks. Yes, thank you for phoning. Analise, could you take the stuff that's ready to the cleaner's? That way we'll get some of it back by this afternoon. Don't you want me to take this? No, I haven't finished with it yet. And I'll finish the stuff in the bedroom too. OK. See you later. Come on, Tony. Let's go. - Who's this? - OK, I'm coming. - And turn that off. We're going now. - OK, I'm coming. I don't know. It was in your jacket. Well, I've never seen her before. Oh, come on! You must know who it is. She's probably worried about you. And this? I mean... What day was this? Whose boat? Well, maybe it isn't my jacket. Or your money? Hi. I didn't think you'd be working today. Just checking some stuff. How are they? They'll do. Do you want some wine? No, I'm driving. We're going to the cottage. Who? Well, me and Sam. I thought it would help if I took him there. Mm-hm. It's the last thing he remembers. It hasn't been easy for me either, you know. I found this in his pocket. Lousy shot. Look on the other side. He doesn't know anything about it. Fine. - I'm leaving Tony with Analise. - Good. Can't you feel any sympathy? No. Joe, is this OK? - Let's take a look. - Hello, Rachel. Don't you like it? I think the blue one's better, Paula. Oh, I think it's really nice. I thought you'd given up doing that sort of stuff. I've changed my mind. Sam's waiting. Bye. Sorry, Sam. I want to play hide and seek. You're too old to play hide and seek. I want to. Well, you can't do it here. There's nowhere to hide. Go into my room. I'll be there in a minute. Tony, will you be OK playing on your own? I've got to lie down for a while. You're always lying down. What is it, Tony? Can we play hide and seek now? I got a little headache. Later on perhaps. I think we should play now. - Can I come in? - Wait a minute. We'll have a quick game. Just a quick game, OK? Big deal! Stay in here. I won't be long. 17, 18, 19, 20. OK, here I come. I'm going to catch you, Tony. Tony! Analise! That's enough, Tony. Going up now. Analise! Come and get me! Oh, it's good to be back here, isn't it? Sam? Someone's been here. Gas? Open some windows. How long's this been on? Ugh! Nothing's missing. Shall we report it? Let's go for a walk. I want to see some more before it gets dark. OK. Ana? Analise? Tony? Analise? Agh! I love this place. I wonder if Tony's treehouse is still here. He never came here, you know, after you left. I think it was over here, wasn't it? Ugh! Sam? Sam! Someone's been here as well. Sam. What is it? You're shivering. Is it something you remember? You're so cold. I missed you. Do you want some more wine? Yeah. Thanks. We used to have some good times here, didn't we? I mean... This was more home than London. - Do you come here with Joe? - Yes. You're not too sure about him, are you? - Well, it's just... - You're not. Are you? It's not like that any more, Sam. I'm going to phone home. See how they're getting on. Hello? Hello? Tony? Hello? Mr Knight? It's Mrs Phillips here from number six. I wonder if you could go and check out my apartment for me. Tony and Analise are there on their own and I can't get through. Delighted to help. You leave it to me, Mrs Phillips. No problem. Thanks. It'll be a pleasure. Bye. Bitch! Ugh! Cheap foreign bulbs. Nothing works properly in this effing country. Who's there? Tony? Is that you, boy? Stop messing about. One of your practical jokes, I suppose. - Hello. - Joe? - Rachel. - Sorry to disturb you. - How are you? - I'm worried about Tony. - Have you tried calling? - No, I can't get through. I called Mr Knight to check things out. He hasn't called me back. Yeah, look, would it help if I went to see if Tony's OK? Would you? - Sure, I'll go. - Thanks. - Just see that everything's OK. - Mm-hm. - I'm a bit worried about them. - Mm-hm. OK, I'll call you from the apartment. OK. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Oh no! What are you doing here? Analise dropped me off. Why? She went out with Michael. You mean she just left you alone? Never mind. Just get in the car, OK? Come on. Where are we going? We're going to the cottage to see your mum. Great! Darling... Darling. You've hurt yourself. Your face! No! Don't go. Rachel... I'm sorry. Are you...? Are you hurt? Stay here. Why? Just do it. Don't open any of the doors, OK? Lock it. Rachel. Rachel? Where's Tony? He's in the car. You've got to get into the car and drive away from here. Christ! Come on. - He's gone! - Look! What is that? Oh! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
